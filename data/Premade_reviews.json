Yes they are all nice and sell a good product and promise this will be covered and that will be covered, until you need tour vehicle fixed.  They deny almost every claim for some little caveat or loop hole.  Then for the items they may happen to approve and it is never 100% of the cost or they want to send the shop the item, which causes more delays.  If they do pay it is by check, so to get your vehicle from not being held hostage you have to pay and then FIGHT to get reimbursed.  I have used other company's like Old Republic that blows this company out of the water in regards to service, timeliness, payment and approval processes.

{"stars":2,"text":"According to the claims on the website, this property just completed a major renovation.  I can't imagine where 4 million $$ was spent.  This Hotel was represented as a 3 1\/2 star up-scale, but fell well below those standards. Our room  came complete with dirty carpet, soiled duvet, someone else's shoes in a drawer, and door security hardware that was not secured to the door as if it had just been kicked in.   The entire hotel is tired looking and not real clean. We  did enjoy the jazz by the pool and the pool area was nice, but it's time to reevaluate this place.  It's a 2 1\/2 star at best. Another note, we booked through Priceline and thought we were getting a great rate ($70) until we got there.  After letting Priceline know we were dissatisfied and the hotel was NOT as represented, Priceline said basically, \"Sorry, here's $10\".

I brought it back to the location and they stated there was only a 1-year warranty on the \"fabric\" which they called \"renew\".  I said fine but the company has been in business for a very long time and has a decent reputation and they kept repeating the 1-year warranty but could repair it for me at MY COST! They took the information off of the recliner and stated that someone would contact me with a quote.  After 3 days, no call. So I called the store and asked for the person and the receptionist stated he was at a different location and transferred me to the warehouse which only has an automated phone system.  Unfortunately, I did not have the person's LAST name so was unable to get through the menu and ended up back at the store. The receptionist stated that she would have him call me back.\n\nReceived a callback and the man advised that the price would be $487 and take 5-6 weeks to get the fabric!! I had purchased the recliner for $599. I told him I would think about it.\n\nI went to a LOCAL furniture store and found a REAL leather recliner for $60 more and bought that one instead. The salesman stated he used to work at the La-Z-Boy store!\n\nI went to the La-Z-Boy store due to the company's reputation not expecting to have the recliner just fall apart.  Sad, just sad.

And the curry rice with chicken was so plain and bland. The curry had this grainy awful taste to it. I have to returned it because it gave me and my boyfriend a really bad stomachache!  We barely touched it, it was that bad! \nWhen I received the check, the total came out to be $70? When I asked why are they charging me the curry rice if we didn't like it and we returned it, the server was saying that we still ate it so they HAD to charge it.\nThe cooks making the food had the worst attitude and face expressions when I returned the dish as well. 2 of the cooks were talking Spanish, looking at our table while giving bad looks. But I'm fluent in Spanish, so I heard what they had to say...\nThe place will literally look for anything to charge you as well. The charge for a side of spicy Mayo? Dare I ask for some water with ice, that'll be another item on the bill. \nI'm not a cheap person and I don't mind paying good money for some good food, but this has to be one of the worst sushi place I've tried so far, service wise. \nI would recommend Sachi ramen down by De La Guerra.

Running bar tabs shouldn't be that difficult, but if you mess up at least have the courtesy to apologize and redo the ticket.

The cushioned seats were nice but we felt like separate parties. I would not recommend this restaurant for large groups.\n\nWe received our food which tasted too under seasoned for the price we paid for. I think other reviews are blinded by the $$$ they have to shell out to notice the blandness. The chefs couldn't even cook our two orders of salmon to wet.

We asked politely and didn't even mention how long we had been waiting.

Our order was shoved in the bag and piled on top of each other as if rushed. We left and i proceeded to make sure our order was correct in the car. I specifically ordered the dry rub applewood and received wings with sauce and was extremely disappointed. Didn't bother to go back in to correct the order because we had already waited 50 minutes. Our fries were soggy, wings were cold, our burger and chicken sand which were crammed inside a small container with all the contents spilled out and my chicken was burnt. The avocado was raw and hard. Mind you I am not a picky eater but our food was not acceptable especially considering how long we had to wait.

{"stars":1,"text":"Internet Access: I am willing to do almost anything short of paper cups on strings to avoid having to use Cox for broadband.  In 2009 we called them after seeing their ads stating that hooking up new service is easy to arrange.  We called them almost a week before our move within the same city.  We were existing customers with no late payments.  I mentioned that internet service was critical to my home office operation.  Service was not, however, enabled at the new location because they terminated the work order without notice or a reason.  After service was up, it became spotty and Cox blamed their modem, offered a new one, and when we resisted this because of the difficulty of reaching anyone who could help via phone, they gave us a direct dial number for their specific \"team\" which was supposedly invested in helping customers get these new modems into the field.  The modem arrived with installation instructions, which we followed, and it did not work.  All efforts to reach them at their special phone number failed.  We tried at least 10 times during the 3 days we were trying ways to get it to work, and for months thereafter.  With no other choice, we reinstalled the OLD modem for what we thought was the interim.  The old modem is still operating 5+ years later, so their diagnosis of \"bad modem\" was incorrect.  The new one never worked and we never reached anyone at Cox to address it.  The price for internet access has gone up much faster than the rate of inflation.  It's indefensible.  \n\nTV: We have the Cox TV Essential package. We never had premium channels, but were OK with that.   This one-step-above-basic- cable package has degraded since 2009 from about 45 channels with mostly substantive programming to 23 channels.  Channels just disappeared like the night sky of a dying universe.  All government access is gone, and most everything else is all informercials all the time.  We refuse to pay more to GET BACK what we had before.   \n\nIt ain't right.  There ought to be a law, so I looked into it.  There is one, a local municipal code, but it only gives customers rights if Cox's picture resolution is degraded.  Obviously 50 years or so out of date.  Time for change.\n\nOn the upside:  Cox customer service is relentlessly polite.   That's the best I can say.","categories":["Internet Service Providers","Television Service Providers","Professional Services","Home Services"]}

I like that they have all booths for tables.  Also, they all dance every 15 minutes or so which keeps the kids entertained.  \n\nI guess the draw is it's something new and the gimmick of a place to show off to your friends hasn't worn off yet until more new restaurants open in Seminole.

The server was friendly and we ordered drinks and appetizers. He was told that a table asked for him, and it went downhill for our table. Once he took our order we had to repeat what we wanted a few times. He didn't return to the table for a very long time. Once the food arrived , it was hot and the flavor was good, but the corn was super over cooked and the shrimp was overcooked. One of my friends decided to ask for better corn. They wouldn't bring her any unless she put the overcooked corn in a container and sent it back. That was ok because she wasn't going to eat it. The worse part was our server somehow put in our orders incorrectly and they added an extra meal that no one ordered. They insisted that one of my friends ordered that meal and ate it, which she had not! They even insisted on opening up her take home bag of food and looked through her leftovers to be sure she wasn't lying about what she had ordered!!!

My daughter is a patient of one of the OB GYN Doctors at UMC with a history of reoccurring ovarian cysts (one of which she had to have surgically removed). When episodes occur she waits it out for as long as she can tolerate the pain. When attention is called to the issue, it takes an act of Congress to get anyone to listen and respond appropriately!  Urgent care won't see her because she has a chronic problem so they refer her to the ER and then the ER Doctor on call only offers to see her if surgery is needed. Okay, so how am I to know she requires surgery if she isn't seen by a Doctor?!?!?! To be offered the suggestion of Tylenol or an appointment three months down the road after hearing that the child we are discussing has been in severe enough pain to want to harm herself for the past four days just makes me wonder where the hell the medical field has gone!

There was so much sauce I felt like I was eating a too-sweet quinoa soup. \n\nI decided to give it another go and NIGHTMARE. I ordered chow fun, beef, broccoli, with the green curry sauce.\nI got back to my office and opened the box and it looked like a box of grey mush. I dug around for the meat and instead i found grey tasteless shoe leather. It had obviously had the life steamed out of it and was poor quality to begin with. There was no nice sear from the wok or flavor to speak of. There were a whopping 2 (!!!) pieces of broccoli among the sea of gelatinous chow fun noodles. The noodles were mush and entirely inedible. I'm floored at the poor quality and execution.

I was surprised and told him I couldn't believe he took our drinks and table when we weren't done with it and he said \"I can't believe you're just sitting there when I have an hour and a half wait\".

Food was good, service was good and we even talked with the manager and told him how much we enjoyed it.  So last night we arrived at about 6:15. It was moderately full but not terrible. Our waitress was very sweet. But then everything hit the fan. My husband asked to sample two beers and I got a pumpkin martini. It took forever to get the two samples and the martini. Can you believe it?  And then even longer for him to get one beer on draft!!! Then we ordered our appetizers and meals. 40 minutes later our appetizers still were no where to be seen. Onion rings and fried pickles!!!!  How does that take 40 minutes? We questioned our waitress and she said the kitchen was really backed up. Come on people, it was a Saturday night. In the restaurant business you know how to accommodate for busy nights.  Finally that came and then another 20 minutes for our meals to come.  My husband got the Herbivore Flatbread and that was delicious. I got the Grouper Sandwich. Very very dry. The mango salsa on top was dried up and paltry, obviously not fresh. I asked for tartar sauce and the waitress left, came back and told us they had none.  First time I've ever heard of a restaurant not having tartar sauce. Needless to say by then I had lost my appetite and couldn't finish it. Based on this we will likely not be back. Odd thing was, there was no offer of compensation or to make things right.

Everything I tried here had a different twist to it than your traditional Italian and I didn't like any of the changes.  The pasta was just OK and the portion was small for the price.

Why allow us to make the reservation? \n\nWe walked in at 10pm for our reservation... First the valet boy runs over anxiously asking if we had a reservation to which we replied yes we do... Then said \"oh well then we've been waiting for you!\"  Now I didn't think anything of it.. In fact I thought he was just kidding. Turns out he wasn't because then some older man who appeared to be the manager says he was waiting for us and we're their last reservation and was about to call to make sure we're still coming. Are you kidding?? We weren't late. I shot my boyfriend a look like \"seriously? We're gonna stay after this?\"  \n\nThe hostess was rude too... On her phone...

When asked questions regarding their sketchy contract, they would stammer and get flustered. After waiting FOUR HOURS for an explanation on a now very dead, very new car and watching them exchange cash with customers there long after we had been there waiting, they ushered us to a back office because they were \"trying to conduct sales and the customers don't need to hear this\". Upon exit, the father\/owner talked in a way that was vaguely threatening and didn't attempt an apology outside of \"I didn't even have to do this for you\".\n\nDon't. Go. Here.

The service was fine - no real complaints or compliments to be had. The beer here is fine - nothing to write home about. But the food - that's where we were really let down. On a date night I'll tolerate a lot because any food\/drink without kids is usually enhanced by the mere fact that I can eat my food and not wear it. Instead, the food was a let-down. The sticky toffee pudding (my wife's #1 favorite desert) was a sugar soaked mess (literally couldn't eat it...gross), the wedge salad had OLD stale bacon (HOW DO YOU MESS UP BACON?!) and the beer cheese soup was bland and boring. I will give compliments to the bag of pretzels which were fantastic - if it weren't for those and the fact that I'll drink just about any beer out there, I'd rate the tap room a single star.","categories":["American (New)","Sandwiches","Brewpubs","Nightlife","Beer","Wine & Spirits","Event Planning & Services","Breweries","German","Food","Local Flavor","Venues & Event Spaces","Restaurants"]}

{"stars":1,"text":"Since Kroger bought Harris Teeter and wiped out over 300 Nashville jobs, I was hopeful that the opening of the new store in the neighborhood would be a ray of sunshine. It was tremendously inconvenient to have our neighborhood store closed for over 6 months, so on opening I expected big, sweeping changes and that it would be equal to or better than Harris Teeter or any other Kroger. Not so in this abominable incarnation.\n\nStart with the shopping carts nearly the same size as the baskets. I can no longer do my weekly shopping in these--not that I would at a store like this. \n\nThe nice man handing out samples inside the door was a nice touch, but there are far fewer free samples than when it was under Harris Teeter's management.\n\nThe layout of the store is virtually identical with maybe a single improvement, but otherwise disappointing changes. The deli section is slightly larger, but the layout of aisles is basically the same. Did we really need to keep the store closed for half a year at massive inconvenience to the neighborhood for such incremental remodeling?! Even the contents of the shelves seem to be the same--perhaps it's just the ubiquity of familiar brands.\n\nThe upstairs is very similar but with now longer aisles. The magazines are there. (Why would you browse for magazines downstairs?) The bathrooms are inconveniently located upstairs in the most distant reaches of the store. At least they are clean (for now) so that when the 3 people who trudge up the sad stairs to use them, they will be pristine. Also no nice pictures of produce in the stairwell.\n\nThe music is uneven and too loud, playing a mix of country--wait, now Charlatans UK--oh back to country.\n\nBut there are two reasons I will give it one star instead of two or three:\n1. Downstairs there is a tawdry Coinstar and lottery machine--conveniences so common in cheaper stores busy shaking down lower and lower middle class Americans. How sad and not appropriate at a store that I hoped would look as good or better than that of Green Hills or Belle Meade.\n2. Cookies have been replaced by cigarettes. My children used to walk out and look at the cookies like an oasis of happiness against the big open windows. Now there are cigarettes locked up in a large metal case. Because that's what I want them to see at the store. Why don't you add some ephedrine or bongs, Kroger? Could you be a little more tawdry?\n\nFinally, when Kroger shuttered the doors of Harris Teeter stores sending its loyal employees to the unemployment line, it encouraged people to seek employment in their remaining stores on re-opening. I did not see a single friendly face of the old HT employees there. I hope they all landed on their feet. \n\nIn short, after over half a year closed and many jobs ruined, Kroger has torn down the old Harris Teeter and replaced it with a tawdry corner store--not the wonderful grocery store we hoped for.","categories":["Drugstores","Shopping","Food","Grocery"]}

She said all the pots, pans, plates, etc, were out in other rooms and they did not have enough of these items for each room. In my humble opinion she could care less, and offered me 2 knives and forks!! It was matter of fact for her. I could see in her body language and face she DID NOT care that my wife could not prepare anything to eat eat in our room. She just went about her business of tending to the front desk. I immediately went to WalMart and bought paper plates, and my wife ate salad in the room that night. The next morning a more caring person did find us everything we needed for my wife to prepare food in our room.\n\nPatrice seemed very robotic and did not and would not go out of her way for anyone or anything.

What's the point of it being Boo at the Zoo? There was an area with game booths but they were so boring. A stage where we thought there might be some performers, but no luck. They played \"If You're Happy and You Know It, Clap Your Hands\" on a tinny recorder for the kids to clap their hands. So we paid $17 for me, a non-member, and $10 each for my son and daughter-in-law and I think an additional amount for my granddaughter, so that she could get $3 worth of candy.\n\nAlso for this kind of money, they should be limiting the crowds a little more. We had to park a literal mile away, and lines within the zoo were long. It's really just a big moneymaker for the zoo.\n\nI gave it two stars because my 2-year-old granddaughter enjoyed getting the candy and seeing all the other children dressed up, but really, this could be done anywhere, a big back yard, a cordoned-off block, a publilc park, and it would be just as cool.

Nevertheless, I ordered the island wings, red bean soup & brown stew chicken. The island wings were very tasty.  The red bean soup was warm but flavorless and they ran out of brown stew chicken so I ordered the jerk chicken.

It was all so very bland & disappointing.  My friend ordered dessert and they were out of that as well.  The only reason why I gave them 2 stars is because of the macaroni & cheese.

{"stars":1,"text":"I don't have words to describe how frustrating my experience with this law firm has been.\nMy divorce case was supposed to be relatively cut and dry. But because I used Turner Law, I was screwed. I filed in March 2015. My case (uncontested, no children, used mediation) was not settled until January 2016. That's nearly a year, for a case that should have been settled within a couple of months.\n\nHere are my complaints:\n\n1. Lack of communication: As another reviewer stated, calls go unreturned, emails unanswered, case being stalled. I think this could be a shady business tactic to charge the customer more money. \n\nI received notice that my original lawyer was leaving the firm, postmarked TWO DAYS BEFORE IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED I was given 48 hours to decided whether I would stay with Turner Law or follow him to a new firm. I wasn't thrilled with his services (turns out that was indicative of Turner Law more than anything) and I'd already paid so much to Turner that I decided I would stay. Big mistake. I had to pester the firm by email and phone to find out who would now be handling my case. I was assigned to a lawyer named Pete Frech. I was told he would be the one taking care of my mediation. WRONG.\n\nLate November 2015 I had mediation with A DIFFERENT LAWYER than I had been assigned. He was named Ryan Logue, Robert Turner himself, and a mediator for my divorce. It went fine. It was a week before Thanksgiving. Mr. Turner told me himself that the final hearing could possibly be scheduled and resolved before Thanksgiving. I was told to appear for court in early December. When I arrived, my lawyer, Ryan Logue, looked shocked to see me there. \"You're not on the docket today,\" he told me. I told him this was indeed the day I was told I was to appear in court. He denied any knowledge of this. I walked to their office from the courthouse and sat for over an hour and a half until Mr. Logue arrived. Apparently, the motion HAD NOT BEEN FILED. Over a month and a half later, and this office hadn't done their damn job. See number two for more on Mr. Logue.\n\nWhen I finally got my final hearing before the judge. It was not Mr. Logue who appeared with me, it was a complete and total stranger whose name I am unaware of. Hell, I don't even know if it was truly the person who I was billed for. They could have sent me in there with any John Doe off the street and I wouldn't know him from Adam.\n\nMy father was helping me make payments (see no. 4) and was told the account had been paid in full when his final payment was received. However, it took two more months and my final bill was received. I still owed over $500, contrary to what they told my father. See no. 3 on this payment plan business.\n\n2. Professionalism (or lackthereof). \nIn addition to the issues outlined above, I was matched with a lawyer (my third, but not last) by the name of Ryan Logue. He attended my mediation in ill-fitting, disheveled dress, and spent his time checking his phone, sighing while the process took too long, tapping his fingers impatiently, and speaking unprofessionally (inappropriately joking about the sexual preferences\/cross dressing activity of someone while I sat in tears at my divorce mediation) during the waiting period. When I came into his office to air my grievances with the handling of my case, Mr. Logue spoke to me with a curt, unprofessional, eye-rolling attitude. He became so upset he actually had to go into the other room and ask the paralegal to come in--from thereon she handled the conversation. He could not even resolve a simple matter regarding why the hell had my final divorce hearing not been put on the books yet--in late December. This was apparently blamed on an ex-paralegal for the firm, but it was Mr. Logue's job to ultimately oversee the case and oversee his subordinates. \n\n3. Payment. It takes too long to get billed (over 2 months for me to receive my final bill), a huge interest rate, and their \"payment plan\" is A MINIMUM of $500 DOLLARS A MONTH. Not all of us are lawyers and able to pay this gargantuan amount every month. That's literally half my mortgage. When I told the person who answers the phone this, he told me \"Well, as long as you're paying $250 a month it won't go to collections.\" So truly, the minimum is $250\/month. Still an exorbitant amount for the average person--it's more than my car payment.\n\n \nHonestly, this is the BARE MINIMUM of what went wrong with this law firm--and I can guarantee I'm not the only one with these complaints. I will never, ever, ever use their services or deal with anyone from that firm ever again.","categories":["Divorce & Family Law","Lawyers","Professional Services","DUI Law","Business Law"]}

No mention was made by her of the supposedly lovely upstairs space I've heard so much tell of--we were simply ordered to sit at an uncomfortable table and wait.\n\nAfter a while, a server came by and went over the menu with us and it turned out the place was out of an unbelievable number of shisha flavors including all but one (!!!) of the twenty-something items listed under their premium selections. The place just seemed run-down, not properly managed, and like whoever owned it did not care about making people comfortable and was more interested in milking Main Line kids for all they're worth. But frankly, my friend and I are both too old for that b.s., so out we went.\n\nI think having to swipe our IDs also put a bad taste in our mouths and tipped us off from the get-go that this was not really our scene.

{"stars":1,"text":"I decided to write this review because my last visit was terrible. There were also a couple visits prior to this that didn't go so well either. I have Been using Southwest Dental Group for the past couple of years now. I had an appointment to see (Dr. Edgar Valderrama, DDS) on June 11th to get a couple of cavities fixed. I didn't get called back till a half hour after my appointment. Once back in the chair it was another 30 minutes before the dentist seen me. Dr. Valderrama ordered x-rays and found that one my teeth not one of the ones I went in for, needed cleaned out and built up for a crown. I waited an additional 30-40 minutes for the Dr. to come and do the build-up. I then waited again for an impression. The assistant Lore apologized that they were so behind because of an assistant did not come in to work this day. The Dr and his assistant were jumping room to room. The assistant did the final impression for the temporary tooth and did the fitting of the temporary. This temporary tooth was very tight and she could never get the floss in between the teeth. All this while my wife and granddaughter had to wait around almost 3 hours to give me a ride home. My wife also said she spoke with the office staff and they told her twice it would be only 30 minutes till I was finished. Later that day after the numbing went away I felt this gritty film on 3 of the teeth around the bad one and it began to fall off  in chunks. \nDr. Valderrama was nice as was his assistant Lore, but they were overwhelmed in my opinion. Lore was even nice enough to call me the next day to see how I was doing. There have been times I come in for a scheduled procedure an when I see the dentist I  have to come back at another time to do the procedure. The front office staff are not very friendly and don't seem to know how to do a schedule. The office staff should have told me they were behind in the beginning and after an hour of not being seen should of asked if I would like to re-schedule. Before leaving the office I asked if I could talk to the office manager Denae Henry. They said she went home sick so I asked to have her call me when she got back. I have yet to receive a call. My wife who also goes here has already found another dentist.\nPlease don't get this wrong the specialty side of this business is very professional and courteous unlike the dental side.","categories":["Dentists","Health & Medical"]}

I have been to this location 5 times within the last couple of months since my job is nearby.\n\nMy biggest problem with this location and the reason for its rating:\n\nHORRIBLE customer service experience on all 4 occasions - 5th time was self check out but I definitely will not be returning.\n\n1st time: I was in line at a register, the person ahead of me had a lottt of groceries, and there were 2 others behind me (each with only about 10-20 things). There was another cashier open but she walked around the aisle as if she wasn't the cashier or as if she was busy. Completely understandable, HOWEVER, once she noticed another team member (assuming manager) she quickly told a woman approaching that she was open. HUH?\n\n2nd time: same cashier. I saw that she was at the register but her light was off. I politely asked if she was open but received no response. So, I went to the next cashier open. (again, only 2 cashiers working.)\n\n3rd time: same cashier, and only cashier that morning. I walked around the registers so that she'll notice I am ready for check out, but she completely ignored me. So, I attempted to do self checkout but it was closed. I asked an employee who was walking by - if any registers were open. He shouted her name and asked if she were open, and she said yes. Once he walked away, she turned on her light, literally did not say one word the entire transaction but did huff and buff the entire time. So unprofessional. \n\n4th time: Giving it another go since its in my nature. The same cashier was there but this time there was another cashier open so I waited in line. This cashier literally spent about 15 minutes talking to the customer about POLITICS, literally. I swear to you not, she spent at least 2 full minutes scanning one item each. (Yes, I clocked the time). She finally rings me up, quickly, only says Hi, and spent the rest of the time talking to her coworker. \n\n5th time: Finally had self checkout open, I used it, and have decided to never return. \n\nUpon looking at the receipt, the cashiers name - Barb H. \n\nFYI: I never write reviews, but because of this horrible experience, it had to be done.","categories":["Grocery","Food","Restaurants","Bakeries","Delis"]}

A summary at best, but to tell the whole story would take 4 pages: \n1.) Bought a car, usual pressure sales situation that ended up taking 4 HOURS of bullshit.  \n2.) Bought a 2 year old VW Passat, drove off the lot and noted no manual or cleaning done, told to return that weekend for detailing.  \n3.) Woke up the next morning to have a ridiculous screeching coming from the bottom of the car apparently now noticeable due to cold weather, called for appointment to bring it in and was told I had to wait a week, didn't even have the car for 12 hours.\n4.) Bring in the car, no loaner available, only been able to drive it for 3 hours out of the 72 I've owned it. \n5.) During service they found cracked engine manifold and 4 recalls that hadn't been done, while waiting for parts I take the car for a day and now the air conditioning is not working at all, so have to get that fixed.\n6.) From there I try and question the \"certified status\", try and return the vehicle as it's a lemon (having to call constantly)...gets escalated to Craig Suntrup who lies to me on the phone and then ducks me for 30 days of very cordial calls just trying to discuss after he claimed he would call me back within 12 hours originally.\n\nApparently Craig Suntrup, who said he'd call me back with a resolution wasn't EVER in the office for 30 days when I called, as well as ignored 30 messages......I'm just going to stop here but long story short, I turned the car into another dealership to get a good one, and even that was a mess due to the warranties I had bought.  If you'd like the full story message me as it's lengthy and extremely ridiculous.\n\nWhat's funny is that after all the crap I went through, I ended up purchasing my current car from another Suntrup location that doesn't use Suntrup in their name strictly because they hate the side of the family that owns this place (see West County Volvo review).  You know you've got issues when you're so bad that you're own family doesn't want to be associated with you.  DON'T BUY ANYTHING FROM THESE GUYS, there are plenty more options and while no car dealer is perfect, these guys made my life hell for 2 months and I ended up losing $1200.00 on the deal.  I wish I could put in all the detail just to convince everyone in St. Louis that they are horrible.  Just to note, I'm not the only person to have this horrible experience.","categories":["Car Dealers","Automotive","Auto Repair"]}

At the time of leaving we requested two free beers just for waiting over an hour for food only and Trent said no.

Service was okay, but everything was highly unorganized and very chaotic. \n\nIt was about 1pm on a Saturday and I don't know what the heck was going on that day, but we waited in the drop off line on the Port of New Orleans Pl for 30 minutes before our taxi turned around and dropped us off on the corner of Convention Ctr Drive and Julia St.  Much better... we just walked a few minutes toward the cruise port building. But when we got there, the luggage drop off area was chaotic!  We dragged our luggage and put it somewhere in the pile ourselves. There was luggage everywhere and just sitting there so if someone wanted to, they could just take off with someone's luggage and nobody would be the wiser.  \n\nOther than the super long waiting line and the chaotic luggage service it was okay.  The Port is conveniently located near the touristy area of the French Quarter.  From there, you could easily take the $1.25 trolly to have a bite at Cafe Du Monde.  Even though I found it unorganized, at the end of the day, I did get to board on time and my luggage wasn't lost so the port is not terrible.

Front swing doors were filthy, sign warning that patience will be needed was filthy, our view of kitchen from our table revealed dirt and disorganization. We were seated with only 4 other tables but our entrees took over an hour after apps were delivered. App was seafood special: grilled calamari bits, 2 each shrimp and scallops in a pool of lemon sauce. Overcooked and overpriced. I had greasy, cold calamari salad, clearly the frozen squid was cooked long before companions veal oscar special. 3 Veal medallions were pounded into gruel, covered with a thick slab of unknown tasteless cheese. In between were bits of rabe with brown patches (supposed to be asparagus) and small bits of crabmeat all drowning in a pool of thinned, nearly tasteless lemon sauce. Even the basket of bread was tasteless except for the lingering aroma of freezer burn. I wish I could find something nice to say but the totality of the negative experience prompted me to warn others. On top of the lousy food and long wait (as Promised) a surly blonde at the owners table near the kitchen seemed put off when she had to get up to seat people, as the waiters were in the weeds.

I explained what I wanted and she refers back to the pictures on the wall. I told her I do have fine hair and wanted to do tighter curls (but not as tight as the girl on the pictures they have you choose from) that would loosen over the evening. She said she was going to pin the curls. I gave 2 stars because she did wash and dry my hair well and was very sweet. She just needs more training. When I went to check out the manager Donna Marie tried to sell me a package and I told her I was not interested. She asked me if I liked my hair and I shook my head. She asked what's wrong. I said I look like a 12 year old Shirley Temple. She looked over and asked if they could fix it. I told her I didn't have time as I had to be ready for an event and that would make me late. I tried to go home and fix my hair. I ended up having to wash my hair all over again and style it which made me 45 minutes late leaving. I have a picture to show what my hair looked like when I left and this was in my car with me not doing anything to it.

{"stars":2,"text":"My girlfriend and I have ordered from this place before (many months ago, I'll admit) and it was decent. Much much later we decided to give it another go. This time they actually stole some money from us. The amount they gave us was not what it was supposed to be (it should have been $17.55 including tax but they told me $19.15) and they claimed it was for a \"delivery charge.\" Their website says delivery is free, and it was free last time we ordered from them, but 17 Snyder insisted there's a charge. I assume they charge extra now depending on how far away they have to go, but their website should really reflect that. I tried to talk about this \"delivery charge\" with the delivery person, a short balding middle-aged asian man, but he barely spoke English at all and stuttered a lot. I gave him $17.55 (exact change for what the total was SUPPOSED to be) but he refused to accept any amount lower than $19.15. I said he could keep the food with him - I would take the $17.55 and come back with $20 - he strongly disagreed, mumbled words that slipped back and forth between English and Chinese, and wouldn't give me back any of the money I had handed over. So fine, I went back upstairs for a few seconds and got money so that he would get exact change, hoping he wouldn't rip me off by escaping with my money AND the food. I starting handing the delivery man $2.10 ($19.65 total), saying I had exact change and he only had to return two of the quarters I gave him in exchange for the dime. He gave me a nickel and quarter, refused to take the dime, and ran for his car. I kept trying to say he owed me 15 cents but he wasn't listening and moved really fast for his age. I'm not too worried about losing 15 cents but there's the principle of the matter to consider. \n\nBefore even GETTING to the food I was extremely displeased. The restaurant had made up some possibly-bogus charge, sent a delivery man who barely spoke English, and stole some of my money. Needless to say I didn't have high hopes for the food, but I remained optimistic since it had been decent last time. \n\nUnfortunately the food was greasy and bland, less quality than our previous order. It still tasted okay and it was basically what we wanted, so I guess that's an \"average\" rating. Most Chinese places seem to do this now.\n\nThe \"open late\" aspect is great, and I haven't been able to take advantage of the beer\/smokes option. but after this latest experience... I don't think I'll be ordering from this place again anytime soon.

{"stars":2,"text":"The wife and I stopped in for a quick dinner before our screening of \"Avengers: Endgame\" on April 25th 2019 and as such ordered a quick meal of a la carte items: refried beans, rice and tortillas so that she could make up simple Vegetarian Burritos for herself, and a Shrimp Quesadilla & Steak Taco Supreme for myself.\n\nAfter a surprisingly long wait for items that is safe to say are premade and waiting in the kitchen (rice, beans, cheeses, tortillas, toppings) we received food that while not inedible was EXTREMELY \"meh\". She actively blanched at the flavor of the refried beans, openly questioned \"What Mexican restaurant can screw up Rice?!?\", and managed to eat two small burritos only due to coming directly from work and having needed food. I saw an earlier showing of the film and needed solid food as well, but my Quesadilla was 4 small shrimp in an oily pool of cheese within a bordering on burnt tortilla, which I ate quickly but absolutely unenthusiastically. I didn't even touch the Taco Supreme, but ate it later that evening and was likely the best item of our order. Which is not a compliment, as the steak was of poor, grisly quality and generally lacking in flavor and overall a sad display of a taco.\n\nThe positives - the fresh chips and salsa was very good, with the salsa having a nice, but not overly spicy kick. Service was generally good, and besides our orders taking too long for what they were, drinks and callback were done appropriately timed. Cleanliness and decor was very nice. Paying the check and heading out was fast and painless, helping make up for the slow service.\n\nTypically unless it's a *terrible* meal and\/or service (which has been very rare for us) we'll give an establishment a second opportunity to redeem themselves.

We get up to order and the cashier didn't know the answer to most of my questions. I then ordered a wrap but asked for it on gluten free bread and they said sure, we finished the transaction and then a few minutes later I was told they could no longer change it to gluten free and was asked to order something else, but the problem is that I was rushed because people were behind me and they made me pay the difference even though they were the ones who told me they could get me the other thing as a gluten free option. So I paid even more money, then my sandwich came out and was so small, I was so disappointed that I paid over $13 for such a small portion. Very disappointed in my experience.

If you wish to satisfy your customers you do so by both accomodating their needs AND making them as comfortable as possible...and Kim could use some serious help in this area! It is true that her \"Best of\" awards ARE IN FACT a result of creating accounts with unknowing customers' emails addresses which the customers are prompted to provide upon arrival or after paying for the service. \n\nKim nearly ripped my skin off because her wax is TOO HOTT and she is way too ROUGH!!! She also drops a lot of curses while she's waxing\/providing services, which made me not only feel uncomfortable but insulted as well. That is NOT the way to talk in front of your customers. Kim also should not expect a tip because she is the OWNER. I could feel the tension between her and the nail salon employees and to be honest, Kim's employees are ignorant, rude, and do not provide good customer service. When working at a spa you act professionally and courteously, not obnoxiously. If you want to have the SPA experience, this is NOT the place for you! The nail salon ladies seem to really enjoy making their cusomters comfortable and relaxed, however, since it is two separate businesses under one roof, you do not necessarily receive the full relaxing experience you expect upon walking in the door. \n\nKim claims to be the Best Waxer, but I guarantee there are MUCH BETTER ones out there. I go to a new esthetician and she is 1,000 times better! She makes the experience everything you would expect it to be. I have friends that have stopped going to Kim as well due to bad experiences and hopefully this review will steer others away as well! Kim claims to know SO much but I have a feeling she is completely fake and remember, she is a business woman, so she wants money no matter what.","categories":["Skin Care","Nail Salons","Beauty & Spas","Tanning"]}

Otherwise, you will end up with limited options and no seating the entire night. \n\nWe paid for the \"Velvet Rope VIP\" experience. This was a big waste of money as the generic buffet we had was not worth the significant difference in price or the early entry. Also - the VIP section is all one big area, so if you stayed at the restaurant to eat you missed out on scoring a prime seating spot in the VIP section because there was actually NO difference for the velvet rope ticket holders. The website talks about the exclusivity of seating at the event...news flash - it is the SAME space as the much cheaper version. Save your money to spend on an actual restaurant in New Orleans and either a) don't go or b) don't pay beyond VIP. \n\nThe event staff were clueless and had no idea about what it meant to be Velvet Rope (or what was playing in their own section). The VIP section in the Elite 1 Ballroom was in the back and you couldn't even see the show from its location. It was so dark in some areas you couldn't tell what food was available.

It was located under an bridge and there were just random people roaming the streets. When I went to buy the tickets, the ticket lady was busy eating food and swatting away flies and was really rude to me. I was like, gimme a break, my Chinese sister. I got the tickets for $15 one way to D.C. After that, my bf and i just waited and waited. The bathroom in the store was disgusting...but I guess that was just a preview to the actual bus.\n\nWhen the bus arrived I wasn't prepared for the rush for the doors. My bf was handling the luggage so I could line up...but instead of a line it was more of a pushing and shoving crowd. When I finally got on the bus I was surprised to see that it was already more than half full! There weren't any 2 seaters left, so we were stuck sitting separately in the back. To make matters worse, the toilet was plugged, and the bus driver came back with a plunger to fix it. What resulted was a leaking toilet and the pungent odor of porta potty toilet fluid and human excrement for the next two and a half hours. It was so horrible. I sat there for two hours with my shirt over my nose, wiling the bus to go faster. The bus itself was dirty, with old seats and trash rolling on the floor.\n\nOverall, it was a terrible experience. I'd rather pay more for a different bus service or amtrak. I felt like my nose hairs were singed from the putrid chemical smell from the toilet.

I came here with my boyfriend and a couple friends for dinner one night recently, and sadly we weren't impressed. I'm a big fan of Asian noodle soups, so I was really excited to try this place, too! \n\nI got the coconut curry noodle soup which sounded promising. The curry broth flavor was initially pretty good, but it was soon overpowered by the huge glob of peanut sauce they put in the bowl. In general, I like peanut sauce but I found the flavor combo really weird, and the peanut sauce was thick and jelly-like in texture, which I found gross. I ate about half of the soup and then gave up. My boyfriend and another friend ordered the brisket soup. Neither of them liked the dish again due to the \"off\" flavor. My other friend who ordered the hand torn soup did enjoy her meal, though. \n\nOn to the drinks...I'm not a big fan of canned beer to begin with, but I figured I'd give a new one a try. They have several options, but I didn't find any standouts on the list. I  decided to go with the Brewers Art brown ale which I found to be super bitter. I wasn't excited about any of the other beer options, so I decided to stop there. One of my friends didn't like the beer she chose either.\n\nAlso, the place is quite small and only has a couple tables up front, so the four of us had to sit side by side at the bar. It was hard to have a conversation with the whole group because it was pretty loud in there. \n\nOverall, I was just disappointed because I've heard so many good things about Cheu. Given my experience, I probably won't be back.

{"stars":1,"text":"NEVER EVER EVER AGAIN!!!! On Tuesday, JCPenney was having a great President's day sale, but I wanted to shop local. I called up Cohen's and asked them to match the price of $265 and Wasin said wow that's a great deal, absolutely. He told me to come in on Wednesday to sign off and pay, and he would let the Wednesday staff know of the sale. \n\nOn Wednesday we got a lot of snow, so I called to ask if we could come Thursday instead. Wasin was not there, but Eli was. Eli told me \"well JCP is out of stock now, so we can't do $265, but we can do $300.\" After arguing with him over what we had agreed upon, he said \"Well I'm not going to kill myself over $80, sorry.\" I was livid and decided I would take my business to a different Cohen's store. I called the location on Dupont Highway and spoke with Mo and told him of the situation. He was very nice, confirmed that JCP did have that deal the day prior, and drew up a sales slip for my husband to come in on Thursday to sign.\n\nSo today (Thursday), my husband went in to sign it. Wasin had been at that location, saw the sales slip, and jacked up the price. His defense was that JCP was out of stock even though they were IN STOCK on Tuesday. When my husband asked to speak to someone above him, he said there was no one above him. My husband asked really? there's no one above you?.... Wasin's answer was \"Only God\". Wasin told my husband that he would sell them to him for $400 and if he wasn't going to take them at that price then to get the f*** out of his store. \n\nBottom Line: I could have just bought the chairs for the $265 at the big box store on Tuesday, but was promised that price at a local store.

Once we were were served our beverages, we ordered and were promptly given our salads. The salads were fine. Caesar salad can't go wrong right? We waited for our main courses, about 15-20, Chicken Ravioli and a Pot Roast. While we were waiting, I noticed that the floor manager was on his cell phone and stood there for 5 minutes in front of costumers. I mentioned it to the waitress, when she brought us our food, that there was an employee on the phone and she explained that it was the manager. He promptly was notified and asked if we needed anything. \nOh just an Johnny Carino's experience please! \nOn inspecting our entree's they were drenched in a thick layer of oil and it was barely edible. We tried to be pleasant as we were passed several time, ignored and not given any drinks or water for the rest of the meal and handed our checks with out so much as a good evening.\nMy friend was given a box for her \"soup\" roast that was barely touched and we decided it was better left there. \n\nWon't be returning.","categories":["Italian","Restaurants"]}

I walked a few feet in and the smell went away, so I thought it was just the rain, so I sat at the bar to have my taco and Margarita. The service was SLOW but nice so I ordered my house Margarita and beef taco. \n\nThe taco came quickly had nice white cheese on it, but that is the only thing that was good about it. The beef was cold, lettuce was brown and the bartender would rather talk to his friends than ask how it was. The shell was from a store, uninspired and crummy as everything else.\n\nThe chips were stale from a store and not good, but the salsa was good, I asked for spicy and it wasn't spicy but I like very hot things.\n\nThe Margarita wasn't very good either, too much sweet & sour, I am spoiled on good Mexico Margarita's though.\n\nOver and out, but I won't be revisiting Estela's again.\n\nOH and the prices for this quality of food are OUTRAGEOUS!

He came back and set the drinks down and complained that we would 'have to come back in about two mins because he had a table of needy old people'. That's just unprofessional and rude.  So we said that's fine but could we have some bread.  To which he replied by throwing his hands up in the air and saying 'why not you before others'.  He stormed off.  And so did we!

{"stars":1,"text":"Purchased Living Social Deals for My Husband and I to try the Spa - didn't know they had a spa at the Ritz - my review below probably explains why!  We booked our reservations the 2nd week in January right after I purchased our living social deals.  A month later on the Friday before our appointments I received a voice mail that someone had double booked our services and then an email canceling my husbands service and re booking him for another time completely without speaking to me first.  I called and eventually got us booked at our original time together. The woman I spoke to was very rude and based out of the Loews.  She apparently double booked a reservation the day prior and instead of calling the other person - just figured she could cancel us.  The whole system seems so unorganized since they have people working at two different locations and scheduling from two different appointment books. \n\nWe arrived early and then sat and waited almost 15 minutes for our services to start.  I chose the deal for a facial and it was the most basic facial I have every experienced. The woman was nice and I would say that she was knowledgeable but perhaps hampered by the lack of resources at her disposal?  She put 5 different products on my face - THAT WAS IT -  no steam, no extractions, no eye treatment (all items I would expect from a Facial that I was told retails for $125.00). I did get a nice massage while my mask was working.  I also tried to upgrade and pay extra for microderm abrasion treatment and was told they did not offer that service at that location.  \n\nMy husband said that his massage felt rushed and he did not receive the extra foot treatment that was part of our deal. When we brought this up to the receptionist he said that he was very sorry - but that the person who booked our services didn't indicate that. Odd - since we presented our Living Social certificates when we walked in - as well as identified that when booking the services in January.  The receptionist was apologetic and suggested when we were deleted us out of the system and re booked due to the scheduling error - we were not booked for the services we paid for!  \n\nOverall I would also say that the spa was nice but did not in ANY WAY feel like it was at the Ritz Carlton - more like a Marriott or a Hyatt.  The rooms were cold and you could hear noise and talking throughout the treatment. \n\nI understand that we paid a discount amount for a service - but the point of these deals are supposed to aid in BUILDING your business.  At other businesses I have had great experiences where the service and up sell has been beyond what my expectation would be.

The online ordering process was easy but they the earliest pick-up time is 20 minutes out. Which I guess would be beneficial if it's busy at the location but there was no one in line when I went. I could have just ordered at the counter. Also, my order wasn't even ready when I arrived. \n\nAnyway, I got the torta sandwich. I choose Al Pastor as my meat since it's new (to me at least). I usually ask for no refried beans but I'm glad I decided to keep it in the torta today because the filling was seriously lacking. I've had Al Pastor pork before at other Mexican places and Taco Bus's version has no flavor. I should have stuck to my usual cochinita pibli. There wasn't that much veggies or mayo either, just a lot of bread. I drenched the torta in their red and green hot sauces. \n\nI also saw that shrimp was no longer on the menu. Taco Bus has gotten more commercialized of course. One of the draws of Taco Bus before was the different types of meat they used to have, including lengua (beef tongue) which was the most tender beef ever!

She looked like she was just \"going through the motions\" of her day. Had she been a little more friendly then the rest of the experience wouldnt have bothered us so much.\nIf you order the all you can eat sushi make sure you eat every single bite. EVERY BITE. We were charged $5 extra for leaving 3 bites....yes 3 bites of sushi behind. Looking back, we should have said something because all of the rolls had an insane amount of rice wrapped around them which was really filling. Not sure if they just don't care as much how the rolls are made for the all you can eat option, but we actually ordered less than we typically would at a \"pay per roll\" sushi place. So we really didn't feel like we had gotton our moneys worth. Also there was one roll that was usually fishy tasting...hence the 3 bites left behind. Dont feel as though it was very fresh. A couple of the other rolls were less than spectacular as well. \nThe lunch buffet is awesome, lots of interesting selection. But if you are going for strictly sushi there are far better places on this side of town. This place used to be better. We had ordered the all you can eat before and never had an issue.\nWe spent over $80 for two people...we splurged and got drinks as well.

I didn't know which barber I wanted to cut my hair since I'd never been there, so I was placed with Frank.\n\nI removed one star because I didn't sit down in a chair until noon. I value punctuality, and if I'm told my appointment is for 11:30am, I expect my appointment to being somewhere near 11:30am, or at least be apologized to when my cut starts very late like it did.\n\nI removed another star because I believe that I was deceived as far as who was going to cut my hair. After I set up my appointment, I looked at the Groom website to learn more about who would be cutting my hair. I see that there are three barbers: Joe, Frank, and BJ. So, needless to say, I expected that the Frank I saw on the website would be cutting my hair. That was not the case. I have since learned that there might be two Franks that cut hair at Groom, and that the other one may have cut my hair. From a business perspective, it would make sense to pair new customers with your better barbers to ensure that they return. Regardless, Frank, or whoever it was that actually cut my hair, made no attempt at conversation, seemed very uninterested in doing his job, and ultimately did not give me what I asked for. I even tried to make it easy for him by showing him a picture. That didn't help. He blended my hair incorrectly, took off too much from the top of my head when I specifically told him to keep it long, and was generally unpleasant. After that cut, I will have to wait four to six months to get some of my hair to the length I want it. So, I removed one start for the quality of the cut. \n\nI get it. You need to hire more barbers to satisfy demand. But when I see three barbers on the website, then walk in to see 5 or 6 barbers, I get nervous. Who are these people? I noticed in another review, someone had their hair cut by a student barber. I can't know if that's what happened to me. That just seems dishonest. Maybe the other barbers that work there are great barbers. But if that's the case, why not advertise them on the website? I'm willing to bet Joe will comment on this review and make it out to be my fault. But in the end, the way I was treated is no way to treat a new customer.\n\nI will likely not return.","categories":["Hair Salons","Barbers","Beauty & Spas"]}

The reason why We did not get a mechanic is simple ,we could not find one at the time and didnt want to risk taking it to a dealer or Pep boys and they put there con artist hands on the vehicle. So in short We took a risk. So if you want to buy a rent a car here is the deal (My personal opion )\n\n#1 . If you have AAA or other membership you receive a discount don't mention it until after they give you a price then ask do they have discounts for membership clubs\n\n#2 If you buy or lease change your tires to a better grade . There tires are generally just bad from wear and tear.See if the car still has the spare tire dummy in back. \n\n#3 Stay away from the cool cars as much as possible theyre generally most popular with customers and will have the most underlying problems \n\n#4 check for dings and dents that look undelrying on the car feel the exterior sometimes people have been in accidents and fixed the car themselves also rental car companies may fix obvious dings by smoothing them over but not fixing it totally \n\n#5 The fuel pump will probably be a concern because it most likely will be on its way out. Its common for rent a car driver to drive close empty on gas , ruining the fuel pump. This is evident when your gas is only on empty .You won't  notice the potential problem if your gas is on full or even half a tank. When your fuel pump is going your car engine will make a wierd noise after gas is put in.After awhile it won't start right away \nHertz should cover this under warranty but finding a dealer service center you can trust good luck. \n\n#6.

The waiting area is terrible, a tiny hallway next to the bar with everyone standing on top of each other.  I got claustrophobic and decided to wait outside.\n-The ambience was a little lacking.

Then waited another 10 sitting down without even getting offered water. Our server was rude and missing for most of the meal, couldn't even get refills for our water. Nearly everyone had a mistake with their food, it took forever to come out, and most of it was burnt and unappetizing. The server even rolled his eyes when we had the audacity to ask for another glass of water. \n\nWe then get out checks with an apparent \"15% gratuity\" charge that is actually half the bill.

{"stars":1,"text":"I have had many meals at Jasmine Thai as well as take out and been pleased with the service and food until last week when placing a take out order.  We were scolded on the phone because the order was taking too long and the restaurant was busy.  It was impossible to talk over the woman scolding us which only took more time.  Finally the order was placed and we were told 30 mins to one hour.  We arrived at the restaurant 45 mins later only to wait a good 20 mins for someone to actually look for our order.  After waiting even longer for them to search and search, each time disappearing into the kitchen, we were told that the order was never put in and that it would be another 30 mins to one hour for the food.  We left empty handed, without even so much as an apology!   I have never been treated so rudely at any establishment.  Needless to say Jasmine Thai is off my list.  There are other Thai restaurants with comparable if not superior food that I am sure would appreciate my business.  Beware ordering take out or visiting at a busy time....not to mention the parking lot is a nightmare.","categories":["Restaurants","Thai","Sushi Bars"]}

I understand we were close to closing around 9:30pm on a Wednesday night. Our server was asking too many questions and we felt rushed if that makes sense.\nOrdered the pre fixed menu which came with soup, I got Gumbo and my other party got turtle soup. Both were cold and flavorless.\nPerhaps because I'm a cook myself that makes me very critical; but this is real.\nThe meal was Quail and mine was shrimp and grits. I'm not joking when I say my shrimp dish was luke warm at best, the grits truly lacked much flavor, it was so disappointing. SO much money spent and such subpar food was served. \nMy party's quail was okay as well, Luke warm. We just wanted to get out at this point. \n\nWe understand that this is a classic restaurant, but it has really declined.

I went to wash my hands, no soap  in the dispenser, the paper towel machine was dangling and broke with no towels so I wiped my hands on my dress to dry them.   The restaurant was very busy, People waiting to get in and I think with how busy the restaurant is they could afford to update the bathroom and paint the stalls and clean up the floor and install soap dispensers and paper towel machines.  The part that made me sick thinking the staff uses that bathroom and no soap to wash their hands during the Covid.  I would have normally given this place a five,  but I'm hoping that somebody will read this and make the owner aware of the bathrooms.

I checked out the Yelp reviews ahead of time to know what to expect.\n\nWe waited about 20 minutes for a table in the outdoor patio. We got seated by friendly staff and drinks were in our hands shortly. \n\nOriginally I wanted the Chicago pan pizza, but the server told me it takes 45 minutes to an hour to prepare. After waiting 20 minutes for our table I didn't want to put us through another long wait just for my pizza, so I went with the thin crust margherita instead with an appetizer of shredded chicken breast.\n\nSurprisingly, the shredded seasoned chicken was the best part of the meal. The pizza itself was very bland, cracker-like. Honestly I've had better frozen pizza from DiGorno's or CPK. Man was I disappointed. It tasted like it had been cooked 30 minutes earlier and been kept under a heat lamp.\n\nMy girl had a pasta dish of some kind. I was going to poach some of her garlic bread, but it was so soggy on one side while being, like the pizza, cracker-esque on the other that I forgo it entirely.\n\nWe had dessert elsewhere otherwise I would have tried the cookie\/ice cream dish.\n\nAll things considered, I WOULD try Oregano's again and go for the pan pizza just to see what the big deal is.

They had no record of our appointment but no worries, took us in right away.  They also up sold us by $5 to the $45 foot\/back massage combo. Even better, so we thought...\n\nWe got a couples room, also great!  The interior was very clean and professional looking.\n\nThen for me, it went downhill.  Bottom line, there is NO way this individual was trained in massage at all, let alone licensed...she began my foot and back massage by rubbing my FACE with BABY OIL, squishing my cheeks, nose and chin oddly and randomly, this way and that.  No rhyme or reason and every few strokes interjected a vigorously uncomfortable two handed full head scratch like I was a large breed dog she was fond of.  After several minutes of this and oil all over my face I asked her to please stop the scratching.  My scalp was hurting at this point.  \n\nShe then moved onto the foot massage portion.  There was absolutely zero reflexology.  Not surprised.  Just more aimless, vigorous rubbing this way and that.  No pressure points, no skill or training. She rubbed hot hot hot stones on my legs making sure to massage my ANKLE BONES with the rocks too, I guess she thought that would feel excellent.\n\nDuring the massage the door was left open and three times someone popped in to have a FULL conversation with the women giving us our massages.  \n\nThen...my therapist passed gas.  Not a little toot, but like a massive, long, wet one.  It took everything in us not to laugh out loud.  I have no idea who was more mortified.  Free aromatherapy, I suppose?!\n\nLast, was the back massage.  This was the least bad part but as you know, at this point that's not saying much.  \n\nIn contrast, my husband thought his lady and massage was great.\n\nSo...I will not be going here ever again and was reminded you get what you pay for.  But, I think my husband might visit once more, LOL.\n\nMoral of the story, believe the one star reviews for this place, appointments not booked, untrained massage therapists, sessions interrupted multiple times...wish I had headed those reviews I read!","categories":["Health & Medical","Skin Care","Massage Therapy","Reflexology","Beauty & Spas","Eyelash Service"]}

My visit occurred during NFL Championship weekend while the second game was on. We expected the crowd to be rowdy since we arrived sometime during the third quarter. However, when your patrons are too inebriated to control themselves, management needs to step in and do something. Now, I will say this was my first visit to Nashville and I'm not sure if this sports bar behavior is \"accepted\" but it was not cool.  My experience, this man kept hitting someone at our table with his backpack because he was too drunk to control his movements. The patron was apologetic at first.  After about the sixth time of this man \"accidentally\" hitting the young lady it became annoying. I suggested he take his backpack off. Surprisingly, he got really defensive and started talking back to me. I informed the waitress and nothing happened or changed. That's when it was time to go! How was the food? It doesn't matter!

On Monday, I had a call stating firstly that the agency had tried to call me weeks before to talk to me, however they did on a phone number that was NOT on my application, and also a dead number. They said legal had been told not to issue me a passport. I was suppose to be leaving in 5 days, Saturday for my trip to Mexico, for 1 week. Well, \na day after I was suppose to have returned from my trip, I got a update notification stating my passport was sent, and I should receive it the next day (which I did). Which was really upsetting, as I lost my airfares, for 2 people (as my friend refused to go by herself), and also a weeks accommodation at the resort. Over $3000.  I never heard why there was a \"legal\" holdup on my application, why they called me on a dead phone number, and why it took them 3 months to approve it.

We've had 3 property mgrs in 6 months. I don't know who the new head of maintenance is or if we even have one. The floors are gross and need to be mopped, the hallway smells of trash because the trash rooms are rarely cleaned. Work orders are piling up.

I asked mgmt to look into the charges of my gas bill  7 months ago, and they STILL have yet to get back to me. \n\nThe 'fixed' elevators continue to skip floors and are very, very slow.  I came home 2 weeks ago to the fire dept investigating toxic fumes coming from an apt in our building and that made a resident sick (it hadn't been ventilated after some work was done.)

So, I figured why not try it myself during restaurant week. So, I drag 6 of my foodie folks & said sure lets give it a shot.\n\nService:\nSo far, when I increased my reservation from a party of 6 to 8, they were accommodating. Our party ended up being a party of 6 as the last 2 bailed due to illness. The restaurant was thankfully gracious & accommodating. \n\nKyle, the bartender was superb. He made us drinks as we waited at the bar for the rest of our party. A friend of mine ordered a Pinot Noir from Williamette valley. Kyle noticed that my friend was unhappy with the bouquet of the Pinot & tasted a bit rancid. Kyle happily opened a new bottle of Pinot to pour. 5 stars to Kyle on my book.\n\nFood:\nHalf of our party was happy with what they ordered: Housemade Soft Pretzels with geen chile-and-beer fondue for small plate, pork loin for large plate & banana bread pudding for dessert. The other half of us? The food was a disappointment. I ordered the beet salad, the butternut squash soup (that was YUMMY) and the Striped bass. Overall, I would only give this place a 2 star. The food was unmentionable and did not leave my palate wanting for more.\n\nRestaurant week is the best time to check out restaurants not because of the price but how can a restaurant stand up to the food and service and entice new customers. Tinto, Mercato & Lolita have been my top 3 best restaurants in Philly because of its consistency - food, service and menu. 10 Arts is a jewel in the city. I tried it last year.

{"stars":1,"text":"If no stars were a rating, that is what I would give.  I shopped at the store, determined what I wanted to buy, and was told 0% financing for a year was available.  Just as I hit the submit button to send the finance application through, he tapped me on the shoulder to tell me he made a mistake and they could only offer 0% for six months.  I said ok and left the store, but the more I thought about it, the more it felt like bait and switch.  So I called the next day and was told my purchase was $1279 and the minimum for 1 year is $1299.  No manager was available for me to speak to.  It is the finance company's rule, so nothing can be done.  The salesman called me back and I asked if I made an additional small purchase, could I get the financing, but later return the unwanted item. He said he'd ask the Manager and get back to me.  Waited 4 weeks - no call back.  Called a couple more times, but was always told no Manager was available.  Finally went to the store and cornered a Manager. I realized the dining room set I wanted was the same one I'd priced at R & F, for over $350 less.  The Manager at Mealys apologized for the issue and offered to sell me the set for $200 less than the originally quoted price.  I declined, showing him the card I had from R&F with the price noted. He emailed his Manager, who was in a meeting, to see if he could offer to match the price.  I was promised a call back within 24 hours.  That was on a Thursday.  On Monday, when I still hadn't heard back, I stopped at Raymour & Flanagan and bought the set.  My cc company has refunded the $179.00 deposit I had made a Mealys through the dispute I filed.  Bottom line, the only way I would shop at Mealys again is if I won the $1000 giveaway they offer for doing a review.","categories":["Mattresses","Furniture Stores","Rugs","Home & Garden","Shopping","Home Decor"]}

{"stars":1,"text":"You claim the used 2014 TR650 Terra I purchased from you is certified.  That's a lie. The bike can stall causing the operator to crash. The bike has a recall but cannot be fixed at any dealer because the recall is in litigation. I have also found other issues that bring any level of \"certification\" into question.  The Transportation Revolution does not care about RIDER SAFETY! They only want to make a sale.\n\nI was charged a prep fee of 495.00$. The prep fee was supposedly to check mechanical problems and proper fluid levels. I personally went through the bike after delivery and found (1) a dirty air filter, (2) a clutch cable that needs replacement (the outer clutch cable housing is frayed to metal), (3) improper radiator fluid levels, (3) missing taillight bracket, and (4) frayed wiring on the wiring harness near battery. It appears like they washed the bike and changed the oil and I can only speculate whether they changed the oil filter.  But that's only the beginning of why I would not recommend doing business with The Transportation Revolution.\n\nAfter signing the paper work and writing a personal check, I went home and was doing more research on the bike while I was waiting for the transaction to be completed.. This is when I came across the recall information concerning the bike and how no solution has been implemented by the manufacturer. I called Mike right away to let him know I was concerned and wanted to cancel the transaction. I spoke with both Mike Mickey (sales) and Michele French (finance). I shared that I would not be comfortable riding the bike after knowing about the recall issue and the related safety concern.  Mike said \"we can't help you\" and gave me the number to the manufacturer. I then called my bank to cancel the check. First thing the following morning I went and talked to Mike and Michele in person. Again, I asked if we could cancel the agreement and even offered to pay for the inconvenience of any additional paper work. Keep in mind this all took place within less than 24 hours. They were still in possession of motorcycle and the check had not been cashed. They did have my signatures on some paper work but that's it. Even after trying to make them understand my concerns with the safety of this motorcycle, Mike told me, \"Sorry buddy we cant just back out of the paper work\". They held my feet to the fire and I had to complete the purchase. The Transportation Revolution  would not let me out of contract.\nI urge anyone who still feels compelled to purchase a used vehicle from this dealer to have a full inspection done by a third party prior to making any commitment to purchase.","categories":["Transportation","Motorcycle Repair","Automotive","Shopping","Motorcycle Dealers","Hotels & Travel","Motorcycle Gear"]}

Fatty beef, chicken that is so-so, and shrimp with a very slight chalky texture (!) tell me that it hasn't improved much.  It's likely the $6.99 lunch buffet price (not including soft drinks) that keeps people coming here.

The chips which we always found to be fresh and flavorful with the mild salsa, seemed to be stale. They reminded me of my dog's rawhide chips.  They were very hard, much harder than any chips we've eaten at dozens of Mexican restaurants.  Usually, we get the chicken enchiladas and they've been terrific.

{"stars":1,"text":"This has got to be the worst vet I have ever been to.  2 years ago, I decided to get my dog neutered.  A neighbor of mine actually used to work at RAU, and suggested it.  I had taken my dog there before.  The first visit seemed OK, but not this time.  The procedure ran me $220.  That is outrageous!  I can get it for $60 at PAWS.  Regardless, I thought RAU would do a good, safe and reliable job.  I was very, very wrong.  It was a botched surgery.  He bled while at the veterinarian, after they held him there for nearly 12 hours.  I was told there would be a chance of minor bleeding, but to call them if it worsened.  On my way back from RAU, he began to bleed even more.  I called, but their office was closed.  The next morning, he bled even more.  I drove all the way back to RAU (I live in Philadelphia), and they said not to worry about it.  Because of such high reviews of RAU, I did not think twice.  I took him home, but a few hours later he again began to bleed.  This time, it was much worse.  I again returned to RAU, and they were far from qualified.  By the instruction of the vet--an older man, who had worked there for over 20 years--I held my dog on the ground as he applied a glue to seal the incision made during the procedure.  For about 25 or 30 minutes, he continued to literally glue my dog together.  I have never heard of such a thing.  Finally, the vet conceded that he did not know what he was doing and advised me to take him to the ER.  I drove nearly 30 minutes to Penn Animal Hospital, all while my dog was bleeding profusely.  I then admitted him to the hospital for the night.  It was near midnight.  For a simple admission to the ER, it is $150.  Along with the medicine administered, I was stuck with a bill of over $400.  If you add the ridiculous price of $220 for the neuter, along with the ER bill, it cost over $600.  RAU then never made any attempt whatsoever to contact me to check on my dog's status.  That is despicable that after their failed attempt to neuter my dog, they took no accountability whatsoever.  I explained the situation to my neighbor who used to work there, and she was infuriated.  She reached out and spoke with RAU, adamantly asking them to call me, but they still did not contact me. \nRAU is the worst place you can take your animal.  He nearly died because of such a terrible job they did.  I highly advise AGAINST RAU.  I suggest about any other vet.  Mt. Airy Animal Hospital has always done a fine job.  RAU is horrible.  I have considered filing suit.  Again, I do not suggest RAU Animal Hospital at all.  It is an unprofessional place and not a place to take a member of your family\/your pet.

We have had two (2) failed Honda batteries since late 2016. After driving from DFW to Tampa Bay, we were greeted by a slow\/hard starting vehicle a few months later. We immediately took it to this dealer and they confirmed the battery had a dead cell.\n\nAfter 2 or 3 hours, they confirmed from the Texas dealer the vehicle was indeed purchased from a Honda dealership and the battery was still under warranty. The battery was replaced, and we were on our way. In late 2017, we relocated to Greater Saint Louis. We recently took a road trip and within 12 hours of arriving back home the car would not start.\n\nJust like before we immediately went to a local Honda dealer. What a surprise we were given. This dealer claims they never serviced our vehicle and had no record of us ever coming in. Unfortunately, we have not found the repair work because it's probably in a box in our basement. How is, that a dealer in Texas has record of the vehicle purchase and battery but this place doesn't have any record at all? Seriously, shouldn't the battery barcode show when and where the battery was purchased? i guess they can track something as small as an air freshener but a product with a 100-month warranty just walks out on its own?","categories":["Car Dealers","Auto Repair","Auto Parts & Supplies","Automotive","Auto Detailing"]}

I was having to store our belongings overnight.  The crew showed up, I walked them through the entire house, told them what went and what didn't, signed the paperwork and they got started.   I had a 51 inch TV and glass stand that was going to go to Goodwill and told them if they wanted it they could have it.  Ok, a few hours into the packing I had to go to the ER and my husband stayed with them.  When I returned a few hours later, they were gone and more than 1\/2 of my house remained.  Extremely upset, I called and spoke with someone who then had a supervisor call me back.  All he offered to do was send a better crew the next day and to personally come in his truck and help us.  What I don't think he understood is that we were already paying for overnight storage so hime coming wasn't going to be helpful.  We were lucky enough to have gained access to the garage at the new house and my husband and I moved until 4a when we simply could do no more.  The distance between the 2 houses is about 30 min.  I have a BMW X5 and we borrowed a friends Jeep and trailer.  Needless to say, it took numerous trips throughout the night.  \n\nThe next day, they sent a different crew who were very nice.  They were well aware that I was upset and when I opened the garage and showed them what we had moved (minus the golf cart) they stood there with shocked looks on their faces and all they could say is \"I'm so sorry\"  They were just as shocked as I was when I saw what had been left behind and moved by my husband and myself.  \n\nThis turned out to be EXTREMELY expensive and we did all of the work.  Not one time did they offer to do a refund in any amount and after the 2nd crew saw the garage, I felt certain I would hear something.  NOTHING!!!  The supervisor did call and ask me if I was happy and yes, I was with the 2nd crew but not at all that we did most of the work.\n\nBTW, that 51 inch TV and stand, it made it on the truck but my husband was told, they were out of room when it came to our stuff.  \n\nI definitely think I will be pursuing further action after reading some of the reviews.","categories":["Movers","Local Services","Home Services"]}

I alerted the front desk and they laughed, apparently paying $500 a night for a room and hearing 3 kids screaming is okay. \n\nPoolside service was incredibly slow.

When I would go to the bar to get my drink our server seemed upset but I said I don't want to wait 30 min for a glass of wine and have it come back to me warm. The service definitely needed help. People also reserved chairs first thing in the morning by putting all their crap on there so when other guests came to the pool you couldnt find a spot. I also didnt see any attendants checking the chairs to make sure if they were open or being used. It was pretty dirty. \n\nOne day I rented us a cabana which was probably one of the worst cabanas experiences I've had. The cabana was filthy, there was food all over the floor and we didn't have our own server so again we had to chase down drinks and food all day. The fan in our cabana was broken as well.

A couple sitting further down the bar said they'd waited for more than half an hour and wouldn't wait any longer. In what seemed to be a few moments the restaurant had cleared out, several leaving without the food they'd ordered. Tables that had come in after our arrival and order began receiving their food. We questioned where our food was and what the hold up might be, and we're told that the others receiving their orders had ordered food that was \"more simple to make.\" When the food arrived, we were unceremoniously told that they had sold out of the biscuits we ordered. The bacon in the omelette was entirely too salty overpowering the flavor of the meal. A \"bowl of fruit\" costing more than $5.00 was nothing more than a side bowl with a few pieces of watermelon. I could have purchased a whole organic, cruelty-free, free range, gluten-free, seedless watermelon for less than half of that cost. \nThe wait staff was out of their element. They looked lost, adrift. The owner was running around from one fire to another, seemingly distracted by whatever he'd been working on a few minutes before. He stopped past the counter and we asked for a refill on our coffees. He gladly agreed, turned around to grab the pot and was distracted by some other issue, wandering off leaving us empty. \nWe expressed concern with the time involved in placing and receiving our order, the taste of the food and the condition of the staff. The response from the all distracted owner was that they'd been slammed earlier, and were struggling with the overflow crowd from a recently closed \"Cajun Kitchen\"?

Anyway- we happened to leave for vacation today and this McDonald's was right on the way to the interstate. We went through the drive-thru because the inside is currently under construction, and that's fine. What is not fine, is receiving snarky and passive-aggressive comments from a lady working the drive-thru. I asked for egg-white on my breakfast sandwich which apparently they no longer carry (which is also fine). But I received a comment stating rudely: \"oh we stopped carrying that a looong time ago,\" and that was pretty uncalled for. A simple statement saying you no longer have that item will suffice. I am also troubled by the passive-aggressive behavior by who I assume is the manager. While we were receiving our food at the second window, we asked if we could have a water since we will be in the car all day and forgot to ask for it when we ordered our food. Now I understand that this can throw the workers off, making a drink they weren't prepared for. However, it's water and it's free. It's not as if we ordered another meal or something. Anyway- the manager stated to the worker at the window \"WE CANT ADD ANYTHING TO AN ORDER\" very loudly to where we could obviously hear it. I don't appreciate passive-aggression. I get that it throws you off a little. But honestly, the service was already a little slow anyway. And I could've slowed it down even more had I approached the manager with my complaints. Regarding the water, either the worker or manager went ahead and prepared it but made sure to roll her eyes when handing it to us. Safe to say I will never be returning.","categories":["Fast Food","Coffee & Tea","Restaurants","Burgers","Food"]}

That being said I ate enough of the stuff to definitely know what is good and what is not.  I also need to confess I'm absolutely terrified of the Kramer painting outside the men's bathroom here!  \n\nThe food is definitely 2 stars and the bar might get up to 3 stars (not for the quality of drinks that are average at best) but based purely on the fact the crowd is generally pretty nice with some decent looking ladies working there.  I would certainly recommend just avoiding eating here and just hang out at the bar or on the patio to drink some decent (but not great) margaritas or better yet just stick to the beer.","categories":["Restaurants","Breakfast & Brunch","Salad","Mexican"]}
{"stars":1,"text":"I'm someone who thoroughly enjoys getting her nails done, I try to make it at least twice a month. I found this salon through a Groupon and thought the deal was pretty good (gel mani + pedi for $27)! However once I got to the salon I noticed something was very very off, to begin the salon looked run down and as if it was on the verge of falling apart. The women there did not acknowledge us right away and then shooed me and my friend off to a pedicure station with lukewarm water. Once she began the pedicure I noticed that nobody wore gloves which made me very uneasy! I asked her if I could use the same color as my friend who was already sitting at the manicure station and she gave me a blank stare and did not budge at all. I then had to settle for whatever color was in her hand because she refused to help me get the other color. When it came to doing my nails they were very rough, I left with a few cuts and scratches and I did not enjoy that at all. \nAlso when I get a gel manicure, I anticipate that it will keep my nail intact for at least a week, it has been 2 days and I already broke one of my nails. \nIn regards to the way we were treated, there were multiple times were they would laugh at us and be very rude to us. They seemed like this was the last place they would want to be and that we were not a priority to them. I definitely felt very uncomfortable and could not wait to leave. \nI will not be going back here.","categories":["Beauty & Spas","Nail Technicians","Skin Care","Hair Removal","Waxing","Massage","Nail Salons"]}

Spoke with Sales Manager Sergio in the phone, who told me he was turning me over to his 'top salesperson.'   Every conversation I had with his 'top salesperson' Marcos, ended with, 'ill have to ask Sergio.'   Was also called by Marcos, and he said he couldn't work on the car deal because Sergio was off that day. I would think their 'top salesperson could find a way to run some numbers on a car.  So apparently, when Sergio is not at work, they can't sell cars.   I gave our required parameters ($300-$500 down, $400 month) the first day.  Three days later \nMarcos calls \"Ok, so we got this '18 Escape for you at $3000 down and $570 a month, does that sound good?\"  I reminded him what we had discussed days earlier.   FIVE days after, he calls again...\"Ok, good news,  we got a Focus approved at $1000 down and $470 a month, what do you think?\"  I said, that wasn't what we discussed price wise, and he replied \"well we got it approved for that amount, I don't know what to tell you.\"  I said that will not work for me, and he said \"Ok, have a nice night\" and hung up.   It wasn't that they couldn't get a deal at the $ I wanted, it is more that they casually mentioned the $3000 and $1000 down, as if we had never discussed our price range.

I finally had a chance to pop in today on my morning walk to the Cedar Park farmer's market. The store has had a cute display of West Philly t-shirts in the window all summer and I was hellbent on purchasing one. However, when I went in the store to browse the t-shirt section I was met with a brusque \"Can I help you?\" in a tone that made it sound like I was doing something wrong by simply skimming through the shirts. When I asked about hoodies, the shop keeper pointed out where they were but in a tone that sounded beyond annoyed. Despite the fact that I loved the hoodies, I left the store immediately. Maybe the shopkeeper was just having a bad day, but sending out such negative vibes to curious patrons surely couldn't make it much better. Service with a smile goes a long way for this shopper and for me, the VIX Emporium experience wasn't a good one.","categories":["Shopping","Arts & Crafts","Children's Clothing","Jewelry","Event Planning & Services","Gift Shops","Flowers & Gifts","Fashion","Cards & Stationery","Women's Clothing"]}

I manage a restaurant and have been in the service industry for years, so I realize that mothers day is the ultimate day in stress and overall chaos, however it will never excuse the behavior of one hostess at the front desk naked Kristen.  We walked in around 545 (without a reservation) so we were not expecting to get sat at all let alone in the near future. My mother inquired when and if they would have a table available for 4, and made sure to apologize for the lack of a reservation and I even chimed in saying we know you're busy and we would be more than happy to come back at later time In the evening.  There were two women standing there (Georgia and kristen) Kristen made sure to let my mother know how incredibly inconvenient it was for her that we walked in and how next time we should have a reservation.  Again, my mother was just inquiring.  As someone who works in the business, I don't believe it is ever necessary to be so rude to someone, especially on mother's day. I would also like to mention that the second woman, Georgia, was so incredibly sweet and understanding.  We actually talked to a few reservations standing up front waiting for their tables, and everyone commented on how rude Kristen was being (reservation or not).  Georgia let us know it wouldn't be until closer to 7 that we might be able to be sat, and that was more than fine. We sat in the bar area and had a drink and chatted while we waited.  The bartenders were definitely quite busy, but still very attentive and sweet.  Once we finally sat down, everything we ordered was delicious, as it always is.  Our server Brett was phenomenal.  Our food took a little long, but it was a holiday so it was totally understandable.  I am giving two stars not for the food or the atmosphere, but for the terrible customer service on one person's part. I hope you are able to resolve the issue because with such a pleasant restaurant, the vibe should be pleasant as well.","categories":["Restaurants","Mediterranean"]}

It was the opening show of the theater's new season.\n\nPros:\n-Theater is beautiful\n-The show was great\n\nCons:\n-They won't let you bring drinks to your seats even though they have a bar right outside the doors and serve drinks right before the show starts.\n-Downstairs bathrooms are small.  They say larger bathrooms were upstairs but I didn't walk all that way to check them out.\n-The legroom in the seats is small.  If you need to get out during the show, everybody has to stand up while you try to walk past and not step on anybody's feet.  It was an ordeal and everybody gets irritated.\n-They do not allow you to stand up and dance during the show.  They have ushers they literally run at a full sprint and tell you to sit down.  Eventually the band told everybody to stand up and we did and the ushers couldn't do anything at that point.  I felt like I was in the movie Footlose where dancing was banned.\n-You are not allowed to take pictures OF ANY KIND.  That includes cell phones.  They have a Nazi female Photo Usher who will run run up on you and get in your face if they see you hold up your cell phone to take a picture.\n\nI think most of the patrons are season seat holders and are likely retired persons.  Most of them likely dont take cell phone pictures.  In this day and age the theater personnel need to get with it and allow photos.  Everybody under 50 years old takes cell phone pictures at concerts to create memories of the experience.\n\nThis theater needs to rethink some of its old fashioned rules.  The show was great but the overzealous ushers left a bad taste in my mouth.","categories":["Performing Arts","Ticket Sales","Arts & Entertainment"]}
{"stars":2,"text":"After reading the long list of Yelp! reviews & food network accolades, we went to Paesano's located at Italian market, 9th street, Philadelphia, PA. First off, this is a really small eatery located in an old neighborhood. So, if you are looking for ambience, this is not the place for you. Secondly, the food is OK but is not great. We had panelle and Gustaio sandwiches. They  were ready in 15 minutes or so .  Both sandwiches were wrapped in a thin tortilla type thin crisp bread and came packed with ingredients & sauce. Because of the heavy ingredients, the think bread was falling apart and this made a  messy eating.  Panelle was kind of spicy due to the hot sauce but was otherwise ok.

{"stars":1,"text":"Copy of the comment\/feedback I sent directly to the company.\n\nVisit occurred on 3\/30\/2018 at 1:40 PM.  \n\nI took my kids to visit your Saint Louis location and had an absolutely disastrous time.  I expected a long wait as usual and ended up being in line about 35 minutes.  This was not a big deal as your location in STL is very popular.  However, everything after that was a collection of the worst customer service I have experienced in quite a long time.  I waited over 40 minutes for my food and eventually gave up and asked for a refund as there were people who has been waiting for over an hour and still had not received their food.  \n\nSince I had plenty of time to observe, I saw two competing processes. First was the walk-in process which I was unfortunately a part of and the second was the call ahead process.  It was quite clear to me that the majority of your staff and resources were dedicated to the call ahead process as there was a steady turn over of customers.  I saw there were delays in this process but only for a few minutes.\n\nThe walk-in process was nothing short of a fiasco.  Pagers were handed out and did not notify customers when their food was ready. I later found out the majority of the pagers were not charged. None of your team members let the customers in waiting know there was an issue. There were multiple spills and dirty tables in the dining area (where you were clearly understaffed for such high volume).\n\nAfter waiting approximately 40 minutes I asked to speak to a manager.  I was told there wasn't one in the building and they did not know when one would return.  One register was out of cash after giving so many refunds and the line had pretty much stopped.  By far the most frustrating part of the experience was having to watch the continued delivery of ALL the walk-in orders.  I could see a few dozen orders just waiting to go while my kids and I continued to wait and watch others eat for over an hour.   \n\nI did want to make note of two team members who cared and tried to correct things. First was Eric who was responsible for cleaning the tables and emptying garbage cans.  He took an active role trying to help the woman who had been waiting more than an hour and delivering food to people who had no idea their pagers did not work. He did this while trying his best to keep up with the cleaning of tables etc. (Again, you were understaffed). The second was Tierra (sp?). She was taking orders, giving refunds and getting an earful from many customers and remained calm (although visibly frustrated). She did not have any support from management and it was quite clear from my conversation that she did not have faith in them.\n\nIn summary, with the exception of Eric and Tierra, you should be embarrassed by the performance of your restaurant and the complete lack of attention to your walk in customers. To get to a point where one of the registers ran out of cash due to the issuing of so many refunds really says it all. I look forward to your response.\n\nRegards,","categories":["Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt","American (Traditional)","Food","Bars","Nightlife","Restaurants"]}

{"stars":2,"text":"Honestly I feel like what was an okay transaction is going to hell. Bought a used car where they charged me nearly $3,000 to \"inspect\" it. Why they would charge that when it should be free and any normal inspection would be under $500. I'm pretty concerned reading some reviews and now question if they even inspected the car at all. It idles rough when at a stop especially when the air compressor goes off. I thought it was going to die on my way home.\n\nThey also threw in some anti theft app that I did not approve and did not ask to get. Didn't even ask me if I wanted it just slipped it in there. I should have known better and read the fine print. Got home to set up this overpriced app that I didn't know I purchased only to find out that it doesn't even work. There's nearly $800 wasted I didn't even know they tacked onto my loan. They will not refund for this useless app that doesn't work.\n\nAsked to get a large paint chip fixed. Was told to just come back when the paint guy is there and that I don't need an appointment. That didn't seem right to me so I called the service department and they said that my salesperson should have set up the appointment and I can't just come in. No one will tell me if this is something where I need to drop off the car, how long it might take nor will they make me an appointment.

If you decide to use an auto body shop within your insurance network I would suggest you either A: make sure it isn't these Jokers, or better yet, B: Reconsider & CHOOSE YOUR OWN SHOP!! This place is beyond terrible!!! They don't call with updates even though they ask you how often you would like to be notified with progress. I've always had to call them. They are currently 3 weeks past the date they said my vehicle would be done & have been \"working on it\" for a total of 8 weeks (2 MONTHS)!!! Totally minor damage, and every excuse in the book for why it's STILL not done. Every Monday they say Friday & every Friday they say Wednesday!!!! They PROMISED me last week it would be done today!! Now they say tomorrow NO PROMISES!!!!!! I drove pass several times and saw my vehicle sitting outside like a stepchild with nothing done. Needless to say this is totally unacceptable. It would have been great of them to be honest from the start and say they are over capacity, instead of wait weeks to tell me that. I totally believe they're using bubble gum & scotch tape to repair cars too!!! Furthermore the wenches answering phones at the front desk are unprofessional AF and never know crap!!!! I learned my lesson, hopefully you'll learn by my example!!! Also if you have Progressive, you should look into another provider!! They're part (if not all) of the problem as well & they gave me a base model bucket as my rental. They'll get their own review on this matter, but these mofos are crooks. They are also charging me $450 on top of my $500 deductible for something my insurance doesn't want to cover. Total\n\nUPDATE: Picked up my car... didn't even make it 1 block before check engine light came on & car began misfiring... Took it back only for them to tell me 3 days later they can't diagnose BMWs!!!! It is currently being repaired at the dealership!!

{"stars":1,"text":"You can find better accommodations. Review contains information regarding: check-in, towels (or lack of), mobile app, cleanliness, & more.\n\nTo begin, I came in town for a wedding and literally could've saved money by staying at a family members house but my sis said she wanted the experience so I was like let's do it!\n\nI'm not sure if it's the same with every Marriott but using the app for this hotel is pointless. They do the bare minimum to act as if they've kept up with the requests. I understand y'all busy because of the location alone but idk, maybe hire some more people who can assist for real? Just a suggestion.\n\nCheck in was crazy, requested to have two rooms near each other days in advance, then messaged in the app on the way, then called again because they didn't answer the app. We figured it really shouldn't be that big of a problem ... ha! We were assigned two rooms hella far (again, we were getting ready for a wedding & needed to have the space to help each other & grab stuff from other rooms so if you have rooms near each other) lol so we spent about 30 minutes at the check in table to get that taken care of HOWEVER ....\n\nWhen we go to the two assigned rooms, I have one key and someone else has another key .. tell me why my key opens an occupied room? I'm like, \"Oh this hotel leaves fruit on the ironing board in ziplocks? Wait, is that a backpack? Oh that's 2 suitcases \" So glad nobody was in there but that just how careless they are. Then the bell hop comes up and was like \"oh this never happens\" well, it just did buddy. He takes 20 minutes to fix it .. I'm like cool, just glad WE didn't have to go back down. We were reassigned two new rooms but the tv in my room been greeting somebody named Rebecca since we got here. None of us named Rebecca  but oh well, that's not a big deal.\n\nBut then, back to the app. I ask them via the app to put the correct room numbers so we can do the mobile keys to the new rooms but, according to the sassy sista working at the front desk who called the room said  \"we can only have access to one set of rooms\" or something lol. I'm like girl, ion have time to keep coming down to chop it up with y'all. So my mobile key has said them other people room this whole time.\n\nSaturday morning a few of us leave. The ones left go to take showers and realize there's no more (clean .. yes some they gave us were dirty) face towels. One calls down to ask about towels, apparently they only have bath towels and won't have any others until noon. EXCUSE ME?! Lmao what you mean you ran out of towels at 9\/10 am? Then they say some people have more people in their rooms than are accounted for, WHAT THAT GOT TO DO WITH ME? If y'all don't go to Walmart and gtf lmao. Then after speaking with the manager who told us he'd bring us the right sized towels, they still brought the big towels. I'm like ..... I'ma just make some smaller towels because clearly that's what you're tempting me to do lol but then they found some.\n\nBut on to the cleanliness, they do \"alright\" for the price you're paying you probably expect top of the line everything but you don't get what you pay for by far lol lil dirt spots everywhere. Comforters, in the bathroom, on the light switch ... you know places you'd expect to be cleaner because you have to come in direct contact with them.\n\nThe valet okay on Friday but once they brought the truck back, it was sent to an off site location because it was over capacity and oversized. Cool .. but the next morning they say you can't call down to request the car service so you need to go downstairs. I'm like okay? They said it would be a 15 minute wait. We go get coffee (about 15 mins) and came back and the car wasn't there. About 20 mins or so later they pull up and say it normally doesn't take that long but there was an accident in the parking lot lol. The next time it wasn't so bad but I'm not too sure if that was because of \"us\" or if it was because someone with me knew someone who worked here. LMAO then when I called to ask about the car service the lady ain't even say nothing .. she asked what I wanted then pressed a button without saying nothing to play an automated message lmaooo the customer service staff is interesting lol.\n\nThe pantry is cool. The Starbucks was good! The lil bourbon lemonade drink from the bar is good too. No room service or anything so make sure you have any extra little snacks or drinks you may need before like 11 if you're not trying to leave the hotel that late. Also, idk about all of the floors but the vending machine on my floor was out of everything lol. The TVs are interesting  now because you can log in to (your) Netflix, prime, etc. but if you don't have those, your tv options are kinda limited.\n\nBut listen, I think they earned a star but just ONE. This was my first hotel stay since covid and they let me down lol. It was just so much to happen and we were really only in the hotel to sleep and change clothes for 2 days.","categories":["American (Traditional)","Event Planning & Services","Hotels & Travel","Hotels","Restaurants","Venues & Event Spaces","Arts & Entertainment"]}

{"stars":2,"text":"She is pretty aggressive; wasn't sensitive to me as a client when I went in for a filling. Previous dentists, before I moved to this city, have always told me \"going to give you a shot now in your gums to numb you..\"\nEspecially stated when they were going to start drilling! (though it's been years since I've had a cavity. Perhaps this is the new way of doing things?!) \nDr Arias just went to town! She seemed to behave  like I wasn't even there. She talked with her hygienist about their price life. I found it very odd.\nDr. Arias also recommended I get Invisalign.\nSoon, I realized she seems to be recommending Invisalign to many clients. When I talked to friends who happen to have a her also as their dentist, it's ironic how they also were told they needed aInvisalign. Since we are in our 30s & 40s, insurance won't cover this.\nShe actually said the same thing to all of us, \"your bite isn't aligned. Invisalign will help fix those problem.\" \nPerhaps the clinic didn't have a lot of clients in midst of the pandemic and now they are recommending Invisalign to several clients.\n$6000 I was told for this.  She is the only Dentist who has EVER told me I needed braces or any sort of treatment to straighten my teeth.\nPrior dentists have ALWAYS asked me if I had braces as a child. (I didn't) i've been told my teeth are very straight and very tight and I have a great smile. Unfortunately, I found a dentist who thinks otherwise. But she's alone- because I've seen five other dentists in five other states.\nSeems they are less about the client's need and more about collecting your money.\nAlso, I found it odd that I couldn't get my dental cleaning and exam done in the same session. (???) Then, they schedule a third appt. for a filling.  My point being, I've been there three times in the last six months. So I have a pretty good observation about what this clinic is about.

The dishes were flavorful, well seasoned and smelled just absolutely delicious.  This past Saturday night I decided to stay in and order some food with a buddy.  Erial Garden is a sure thing right?  Wrong.  We both got the General Tso's.  I ordered the wonton with hot sesame sauce and my buddy got a wonton egg drop soup mix.  Both our meals came with rice and egg rolls.\n\nThe egg roll was cold.  HUGE disappointment.  The wonton's themselves are good, but they consider a hot sesame sauce is entirely different than I experience at 99% of chinese restaurants.  It is accompanied with huge globs of peanut butter (huh?) and mounds of sesame seeds while the \"sauce\" is on the bottom.  The sauce wasn't very good to me anyway, but my buddy mixed everything up and said it was passable (former chinese restaurant owner BTW).  After going 0 for 2....I knew I couldn't possibly be disappointed by the General Tso's right? It's always super yummy with a little extra kick to it.  What happened? Very dry and flavorless chicken with not very fresh rice.  There was 0 spiciness factor.  There were visible peppercorns...but not spiciness.\n\nI'm just desperate to find a decent chinese place anymore.  Anywhere around my apartment is completely useless other than Han Dynasty.

As Spaniards living in the US, we come from a rich culture of good, healthy and tasty food, so I feel we are not the typical tourist that gets excited because a place is packed with people and candle lights. Let's get to the point: this place is a tourist trap. Actually, it is a perfect tourist trap, because is not in the French Quarter, so you don't expect the trap. We heard really good things about this place, from nobody local (lesson: ask the locals), and we gave it a shot. The restaurant is incredibly overpriced (we paid 100 dollars tip included for mediocre food). The corn bread was good but nothing spectacular. My wife ordered fish and it was just OK. You expect excellence for 26 dollars a plate. I ordered the duck and it was undercooked. The things they add to try to enhance the flavor on this plate is like a stupid exercise of childish cooking style. We ordered the eggplant as a starter and it was the best thing we had, but again, nothing spectacular. I had enjoyed Five Guys burgers more than anything I had here. I feel like this place used to be really good some years ago and maybe it got so popular that they don't need to cook decently anymore to get clients.

When I went with my nephew last week, many of the exhibits did not even have fish or animals in them. Many of tanks \/ glass were dirty. There was only one sea otter in the \"sea otters\" exhibit and the viewing area was up too high for me to see much less my three year old nephew. The worst by far was the penguin exhibit - overcrowded, the penguins just stood around listless; there was hardly any room for them to swim. It was very sad. To top it all off, Audubon Aquarium is ridiculously expensive.

It has many, many beers on tap -- which is appropriate for a place called the Tap Room, I suppose -- and a limited but well-curated menu featuring the sort of things one might expect on offer at a tap room -- sandwiches, burgers, and a couple of salads. \n\nThe seating is at tables with picnic-style benches, nice for a group. They also have a bar with seating, and a separate area with outlets (how very accommodating!) for computer users to hang out and use the free Whole Foods wi-fi. \n\nI wasn't really impressed with the food. I ordered a chicken Caesar, and struggled to detect the dressing. There didn't appear to be any on the salad; it was a rather tasteless experience. I do commend them, however, for not overcooking the chicken, which is, sadly, a rather common occurrence in our \"terrified of food poisoning\" society. My companion ordered a cheeseburger, which he appeared to enjoy, and came accompanied by sweet potato shoestring fries and some yummy dipping aioli sauce and ketchup. The fries were the best thing I tasted there. \n\nIt was okay, sort of a \"meh\" experience as far as food and ambiance, but it's convenient if you want to grab a bite at Whole Foods. Myself?

The cheese on top was melted and everything actually looked pretty good, but then I cut into them. The cheese in the enchiladas is literally cold shredded cheese. Not melted, not even warm.

They must be out somewhere and I haven't noticed them. But still most places give you napkins when you aren't eating in. Apparently not the case here. Finally, it would be nice if they could cut the pieces of romaine smaller. I mean you're already cutting them anyway, why not make them a size that fits in my mouth?\n\nUPDATE: went in at around 1pm to try the pizza. Was a long line so couldn't see that there wasn't any until I got up there. Then I asked about it and the girl matter of factly told me they only make a certain amount and when they run out they don't make any more. Okayyy I kind of get that.

After spending almost $2000 on a queen mattress & adjustable base, and additional $100+ on the service plan we were told (by the salesperson Nick) at the time of purchase that we would be given the required brackets that would allow the headboard (separate company) to attach to the base unit.  \nWhen I called back to tell them about the necessary bracket part, I was told \"we don't have them in stock\" and no one bothered to return my call.  After two more calls, the store manager, Pam (who always seems to be out of the store location) had yet to return the messages I'd left.  \nAdditionally, from my research, I found out that Mealey's should not even be selling this particular \"branded Ashley\" adjustable base frame.

Therefore, I say this because I've been to Bartaco many times before from when it's slammed pack for Friday Happy Hour to a weekday lunch\/dinner. Well, yesterday was a dinning experience at Bartaco that left a very bad taste in my entire groups mouth. I'm used to great service (even when it's slammed) and that was not present yesterday (when it wasn't busy). \n\nLet's start at the beginning, we sit outside and now a days we ALL are very use to using the CR Code at the table, right? Well, they took a simple CR Code Scan to view the menu to another level that is SO NOT USER FRIENDLY! I MEAN LIKE AWFUL! Our group wanted to be all on the same tab as it was a BUSINESS meeting. Should be easy, well not anymore at Bartaco. So, we sit down outside and immediately struggle with the CR Code. We can't figure out how to combine checks so we start passing the phone around to order AKA NOT USER FRIENDLY. Eventually someone comes to the table with waters and explains how to order from our individual phones on the same check. Well, that turns out to be a HUGE issue. All of our food comes out at different times. 3 of us had food delivered at the same time, 10 minutes later two others get their food, leaving one individual with out any food (keep in mind she ordered 3 tacos like the other 2). We then ask about her food and where it is? \"It's on the way\" or \"Let me go check\". It starts raining to we move inside and STILL one person in our party hasn't gotten any food, while everyone else is done eating and they've even removed the rest of our plates from the table. LIKE NEWS FLASH PEOPLE- SHE STILL HAS NO FOOD!!!!!!!!! Finally, her tacos come out and she's eating by herself while we sit there. That's not how dining out is supposed to be, especially for a work lunch. We even asked an employee \"Why is it taking so long? Do you all not have servers anymore?\" The response we got was \"No, we just scan the tables.\" I'm sorry WHAT?!?! You may as well be a damn food truck at this point. \n\nSo Bartaco, why are you steering away from what has worked in the past and has made the business as successful as it was? Customer service is important and you've removed servers, added a terrible app to order on while still keeping your price point the same. It's not okay and INCREDIBLY unacceptable.

Needless to say that for probably most of us there, meal-time was easily the most favored time of the day. The food wasn't quite the same as what was experienced in momma's kitchen, but you knew you were going to get just a few minutes of belly-filling nourishment.

A vibe that suggests that the owner is happy to see you and hopes you enjoy the meal. Not so much here. It was a bit like the chow line mentioned above. I was greeted. The food was prepared and edible. The food was rung up correctly and that was about it. The excitement that I usually get from this line of restaurant just wasn't there. What caused me to rate this place a single broken plastic fork turned down was the lack of my desired soda. The dispenser was empty. I know it seems simple but it is a big deal after what happened next. I asked if a refill was available so I waited 8 minutes. The refill was never brought out.

The pad thai (the dish I use to rate all thai restaurants) was made with thin noodles, I prefer the slightly wider (linguini size) noodles.  The sauce was significantly over-salted (offensively so)... the chicken was over cooked (cooked and then cooked again) and tough. Probably a 1.5 star...in my opinion, it's a pass.","categories":["Thai","Restaurants"]}

{"stars":1,"text":"Bought the Groupon for this place and definitely regret it. Service was extremely slow to begin with, we were offered a free refill on our drinks so we appreciated that and decided to give the restaurant a chance. This was just the beginning of our bad experience though. They were completely out of crab so I couldn't order the seafood boil I wanted so I chose the shrimp only one. The food took an extremely long time. We were seated at 6:45 and didn't get our food until 7:45. The restaurant wasn't full, yet service remained slow. I got my seafood boil and the shrimp was very undercooked and tasted like they hadn't been cleaned. The sausage wasn't cut up into pieces, just served whole, sliced slightly, and undercooked. The sausage was still mushy and I didn't notice until after my first two bites. I couldn't finish my meal because of these reasons and the manager took it off the bill for us thankfully. We were offered free dessert so we ate the bread pudding. After this experience, I decided not to write a negative review because of how the staff seemed to care and handle the situation, however I changed my mind after my night was filled with an awful stomachache and a few trips to the bathroom in the middle of the night. Definitely put a damper on my vacation since I have not had this reaction from any other restaurant in New Orleans. Also, the waiter took my phone away from the table for five minutes to get the manager to scan my Groupon code. As I was getting up to go find it he walked over with it and handed it back to me. Just an overall bad experience at this restaurant that was actually recommended by a friend who lives here.","categories":["Restaurants","Seafood","Vegetarian","American (Traditional)","Cajun\/Creole"]}

The floors were in horrible condition. Trash and food all over the restaurant. The hostess cleaned off a table but wiping the food crumbs to the floor then sat a customer at that table without sweeping the floor. The customer pointed it out and then they swept but just by that table. The restroom was the same way with paper towels all over the floor. My drink came out in a dirty glass with food stuck to the outside of the glass. \n\nI did give them 2 stars only because the food was pretty good and was warm when it came out. The draw back about the food was that two sandwiches fries and two sodas totaled $33.00 with tax. Too much for sandwiches. \n\nOver priced food, dirty store. Not worth going back.\n\nWrote this review then saw the other reviews. It looks like a recent history of this location being dirty. I'd be afraid of how dirty the kitchen is.

I call the 800 number and the service rep, based on what I verbalized, tells me that there are three anticipated services and that they will require a $149 pre-payment before they schedule and send out a rep. I point out to them that we can anticipate what might be needed but it could be easier after an on-site assessment or more complex. They refuse to do further business unless I pre-pay, even though I might not be satisfied with their on-site performance.

We were disappointed by about all aspects of the dining experience, not just the food. First of all, getting this place to split a check is like pulling teeth, so good luck trying to figure out the math on your own and writing out who got what on a piece of paper for the server (note, we only needed four separate checks, it's not like we're talking about a party of 12 here). \n\nBesides the issue of the checks and that it took about a half hour to get it all sorted out, our food came out at completely separate times. A few of the meals came out together, but one of my friends and I both waited over 10 minutes for our meals to come out after the others did. When they did come out, we did not receive any kind of apology or even an acknowledgement that the rest of the meals were very delayed. In fact, service was very slow in general, and I know many friends who have been there at separate times and have shared the same sentiment.\n\nTo make matters worse, the food wasn't anything special, despite the claim of \"Best Brunch Around.\" I will admit that the burgers did look decent, so maybe if we had gotten lunch\/dinner food it would have been okay.

Today we were going for my friends birthday for drinks and food, however the experience we had was unbelievably horrible. We enter the parking lot to meet a old man for a parking attendant, who was not in a good mood. My friend who is handicapped and has back problems was asked by him in a sarcastic tone if she could even drive and if she had her license. We told him she is 24 and is handicapped but yes, she is able to drive. As we were trying to back the car in  (he wanted us to park in reverse for whatever reason) he was very impatient with us, and told us to hurry up because we were holding up traffic...keep in mind there was only 1 car behind us that could have easily just parked next to us without any disturbance. As we told the old man parking assistant to stop rushing us as we are trying to park, he tells us to leave to another bar and beach. My handicapped friend got out of the car and told him \"I apologize sir, I am handicapped and I can drive, however I do have a bit of trouble parking in reverse because of my back and I cannot walk far distances. This is my favorite bar and I just want to park .\" He then scoffed and replied \"wow, that's fucking great, just go.\" we were extremely insulted that he was so discriminatory towards our handicapped friend. We left and called management and spoke to Karen. She told us she cannot assist us as she is busy and he is the only assistant and told us to come by another time. The customer service as this place is absolutely insulting and horrible. I do not appreciate being told to leave because my handicapped friend cannot park in reverse. Keep in mind we could not have anyone else drive her car for her because her seat is broken and cannot be moved back, so nobody else fit in the front seat to drive.

The pasta was delicate and the sauce was tasty although it appeared to be swimming in it and the presentation was not the best. The braised lamb was also tasty but for $29 at full price, I think it is overpriced as it does not come with any vegetables or starch on the side. \n\nService was sub par in my opinion for a white tablecloth place. Our server was hard to track down and get his attention even though he was walking around the floor often. It felt almost as if he was purposely avoiding our attention.

Sadly that proved to be true.\n\nI arrived early to meet the lovely wife so I thought I'd have a drink at the bar.  The place is huge and not in very good shape.  Everything looks a bit beat up.  The men's bathroom was deplorable.  As a sports bar there are lots of TVs but many are poorly placed so the sight lines are tough.  The bartender was OK.  My drink was weak and the Happy Hour price was not competitive.  So let's say that so far I was not impressed.\n\nOff I go to a reserved section for a private party.  It was a three hour cocktail party with open bar and snack food. The space was too small for the group so everyone was jammed together.  There was not enough seating so many folks stood for three hours.  The staff was clearly overwhelmed in every way.  The bartenders had trouble keeping up with the drink orders.  They could not replenish the food fast enough and what was served was substandard at best.  My fellow party goers were great so that saved the night.\n\nThe location of this place is fantastic.  It's connected to the convention center and right next door to the Marriott.  If you are from out of town attending a convention it would be a natural place to visit and that's sad.

{"stars":1,"text":"We wanted to love Element because it is in a great building, has cool, contemporary style, an open concept kitchen, and attentive service. Unfortunately, the food was not very good. My chicken wing appetizer was ample, but lacking in taste. I've had better wings in bars and restaurants all over America. The skimpy, but artfully presented, beet salad was flavorless despite a trio of sauces. The chef should know that you can guarantee flavor simply by roasting rather than boiling the beets. My ribeye steak was cooked to my specifications and tasted okay, but a pat of butter lay on top of it until I spread it over the meat. The lukewarm steak was accompanied by baby carrots that were infused with pepper and greens that were over-seasoned with salt. \n\nMy wife's pork belly main course was an inedible glob of quivering fat. After being unable to locate more than a bite of actual meat she returned it to the kitchen. When the chef came to our table to explain the nature of pork belly his comments could be interpreted as either a challenge to my wife's honesty or questioning her knowledge of cuisine. Either way his defensive remarks were uncalled for. The waitress did the right thing by removing the pork belly from our bill and offering my wife free dessert, but we deferred. We will not be returning.","categories":["Food","Restaurants","American (New)"]}

There were too much black pepper and an overwhelming amount of onions in their roast pork sandwich. Perhaps it's a personal preference but I should be given the option to opt out of the onion and black peppers. The sesame bread was too hard and why is there no wiz???!!!! The provolone cheese was moldy and the sandwich left me unsatisfied. The server seemed annoyed with the orders because there were apparently 2 different lines for the 4-5 different sandwiches that they offer. Sorry but if I'm on the wrong line it is likely that the signage was ineffective. Perhaps a more descriptive set of instructions would help....but then again there were only 4-5 different types of sandwiches so it really is not that serious.

{"stars":2,"text":"Now, I know this isn't the fault of the venue, but it took three hours to get from LA to SB! The crazy thing is most of the traffic was in Ventura, not LA, due to an accident on that 2-lane section right before SB. No way around it. Not a great start to the day. Luckily, we left early enough to have dinner and make it to the Bowl just in time for the first notes of the main show.\n\nWe missed the opener because, frankly, 7pm is awfully early to start a rock concert. It's sort of weird that the Bowl is right in the middle of a residential neighborhood and I guess that's the reason shows have to start so early - to end by the 10pm noise curfew. How did a largish music venue end up in the middle of a residential neighborhood? Odd. Luckily, residential parking was free and copious, so that's one bonus for the evening. \n\nOnce we got to the venue, we stood in line waiting for general admission wristbands for 20 minutes. Then, once we walked up the hill, a misinformed security guy kept telling us we had to wait in line AGAIN even though we had wristbands. So, reluctantly, we waited in another line for 10 min. When we got to the front, the venue worker was passing out more wristbands and asked us why we were waiting in line if we already had one! ARGH...I told her the guy standing 10 feet away told us to. She apologized, at least. \n\nAt that moment, the main show started and we rushed into the bathrooms to use them when everyone else was rushing out. Bathrooms were nice! General admission standing was also pretty relaxed and we weren't terribly cramped. As a 5'1 woman, it's always hard for me to stand in the pit and try to see the stage, but this time I actually got to see quite a good chunk of the show. It's a nice venue, with the open air and the stars and the more \"intimate\" feeling that you can't really get from many outdoor venues elsewhere in Socal. If we didn't have to go through the line debacle, it would have been a really pleasant venue experience. \n\nOverall, the trip was strange, as SB has a unique vibe that I'm not altogether comfortable with, coming from the chaotic rush of LA. SB is slow-moving and since we didn't find the downtown area until later in the night as we drove through, the part we ate dinner in was sort of abandoned and creepy, with disheveled men passing us occasionally. \n\nWalking from our car to the venue, I heard other Angelenos talking about their ride up and suddenly I felt like a tool driving up from LA, another almost-hipster with urban arrogance. It's like the Family Guy episode where New Yorkers go to Quahog to watch the leaves fall - city folk invading a nice, quiet seaside town and then complaining about its amenities. Ugh, I'm not proud of it, but it is what it is. Maybe I'll try SB again under better conditions, knowing more what to expect.","categories":["Nightlife","Music Venues","Arts & Entertainment"]}

I had both my boys (4 and 10) and my mother who was in a wheelchair. I was semi greeted by the gentleman. I explained to him I was looking for a new pair of glasses for my son. He looked up some information in the computer and then asked me if I wanted the prescription from last year (in a condescending tone) which I replied yes. I mentioned we might use the keystone first insurance my children have and his snotty reply was \"we don't except keystone first\". As if is a lower class insurance. This is when I noticed both my kids playing with their sample lenses. I grab the lenses out of their hands and put them back. I took my 10 year old over to the kids glasses and started trying to help him. My mom in her wheelchair was trying to help keep the 4 year old in check while looking for herself. After we concluded there was nothing their my oldest would like we decided to wait. I turned around and noticed the same associate not vigorously cleaning the sample lenses my kids were touching. I figured okay makes sense since my kids just figured them up. I asked if he could adjust my son glasses. He seemed annoyed but then did so. When he went back behind the counter and my back was turned he then very rudely said \"can you please...there are not toys\". When I turned back around I saw my 4 year old playing with the sample lenses again. I took them out of his hands and put them back. \n\nI get my kids were in the wrong but considering I was a person who was trying to accomplish a task with a disabled adult and two kids the attitude I received from this associate was unnecessary. Clearly I was trying to give my 10 year old my attention while keeping my 4 year old in check and help my mother at the same time. I know those sample lenses are not toys!! The fact that the kids were in the building seemed to irritate this gentlemen. This is also not the first time I have experienced this same pretentious attitude from this associate. I work in customer service and I get it, some days just are bad. However, this is unnecessary and made me feel as if my kids were unwelcomed.

No TV guide or menu so you had to wander through the channels and had no idea what you were watching.  Room was TINY and bathroom was even smaller still.  No clock.  Thin, threadbare towels, no shampoo or anything except two small bars of soap.  Cold, mono-chromatic, sterile, very uninviting.   And the bed... a thin foam mattress with no box springs.  Woke up about 2 hours after laying down and could not even stand up my back hurt so much.   Freeway noise, thin walls and parking were all problems too.  WORST HOTEL STAY I HAVE EVER HAD.

They didn't have many items listed on the menu. 3 or 4 more people came in behind us and it was too much for (mom) to keep up with. It was easier to ask what they had than to try and order what you wanted. I got extra meat-ribs. I don't remember what sides, but I know they were not fresh. The ribs were leftover and reheated. They were tough and dry. What was worse was that I was not a writer for Yelp yet so I reviewed Bukks on his website. We all know that reviews are to help companies improve their businesses. Not Bukk! He does not take criticism well. Because I told the truth about my opinion of the food I received, he jumped all over me for my review. I will not be bullied for my honest opinion about any restaurant.","categories":["Barbeque","Restaurants","American (Traditional)","Soul Food","Southern"]}
{"stars":2,"text":"Roasted: CC's in the French Quarter was where we chose to go to for our coffee fix. It's a chain here so walking in I didn't have high expectations. Staff was friendly and engaging. They have a small amount of seating and a decent menu selection including sugar free options. It feels like a chain and really doesn't feel like we are in New Orleans. The barista wasn't sure what breve was and I had to stop him from using 2% milk to ensure we got the right milk. The milk was not foamed well - the barista didn't know how to steam properly causing the milk to be super bubbly and airy. However the latte tasted quite good in the end despite it looking bad. I enjoyed it and it was enough to leave me satisfied. I wouldn't necessarily come back considering I know there are some stellar coffee shops in NoLa. \n\nUnroasted: I think the last time we visited NOLA we tried to visit this place but it didn't work out.    Glad we stopped in today because it's a cute shop on the corner St Phillip and Royal.  Coffee chains are never that well.  This is surprising pretty good.   Nice assortment of sugar free flavors.   My latte was actually drinkable.   I recommend if you are in the area.","categories":["Coffee & Tea","Food","Restaurants"]}
{"stars":1,"text":"I have been going here for years with Linda , the owner doing my nails, I made an appointment in advance for nails and a pedicure for my daughter's wedding, taking the morning off from work to have done. Linda has known for many visits that my daughter was getting married. Pedicure goes great, go to sit down to have my nails done - chit chatting about the wedding and halfway through asked her to please even out  few nails as a few were crooked before she began polishing, she looks at me like I offended HER and without a word gets up and walks away. Disappears into the back of the shop and here I am sitting for 10 + minutes waiting for her to return, no Linda. Her daughter who also works in the shop walks to the back and comes back out sits down saying that she will finish my nails? Linda then walks from the back and sits down with a customer who is waiting for a pedicure and begins to work on the customer? I was astounded that any professional would behave that way and I was upset as had been coming here for years and she was usually pleasant. I was frustrated but I kept my mouth shut and as I was leaving to go out of town a few hours later for the wedding, let her daughter finish my nails as opposed to walking out as I should have. I paid $70 to have my nails done and Being the better person left a tip for them both- And result? $90 out of my Pocket for a refill,polish and a pedicure and they lost a good customer forever.\n\nAs there are literally dozens of nail shops around  my area with my money green anywhere, what is wrong to expect a little customer service and a shop owner to be a professional instead of acting like she is doing me a favor? I have gone there for almost 5 years and will never step another foot in that shop and their small business just got smaller!.","categories":["Beauty & Spas","Nail Salons"]}

We were heading out the door, without food, when he came back with two hastily prepared dishes (the wrap was falling apart on the plate). The waitress never came over to us (although she was in the main room), and we asked for the check.

This however is another story. \nI will start with the hostess, who told us it would be a few minutes before our table was ready. No big deal as we informed her we would head to the bar for a cocktail. We placed an order for drinks, only to be interrupted by the hostess who stated that our table was ready. I informed her that we ordered cocktails and would be just a minute. Now this is a first, she looked at us and said sorry, although we do not look busy now, we have to adhere to the reservation time and you cannot sit at the bar and wait for a drink. REALLY! \nOK, so we informed the bartender of the change of plans. We are then walked over to a table in the upper left hand side of the room, but were told the chairs and couch we were to sit in cannot be moved out for us to fit since the adjoining tables were touching the backs of the chairs. We reluctantly sat down and waited a few minutes for our server Ricky to come over. He happened to be the only bright spot of the evening. We asked him if the small table across from us was his and after he relied yes, we asked to be moved. He had to go check with the hostess if that was OK, and came back and said yes. When we asked him why the tables were so close together, he responded by saying that for Valentine's weekend that they squeeze in as many additional tables as they can. \nNeedless to say, after ordering our first cocktails, we waited approx 15 minutes for them. Had we stayed at the bar for our original order we would have enjoyed them without the wait. \nNow for the food. While my wife was looking forward to surf and turf and I settled on a dry aged porterhouse with Oscar topping, we also had a shrimp cocktail and oysters. Nothing special by any means. The wedge salad was actually our high point and for $13 for 1\/4 head of iceberg, just a tad overpriced. \nWhen the entree's came out, they looked wonderful. The lobster tail was a nice size. The filet was raw, cold, raw center not the slightest bit warmed or cooked. We asked for it to be redone and within 2 minutes the manager brought it back over. He barely apologized as he slid it back onto my wife's plate. While the outer was now char coaled, the  meat itself was still raw. However, the manager never made eye contact, now did he come over to see why the steak remained untouched.\nThe porter house was nothing special and for the price was way too much. We have had better steaks at many steak houses and lower budget restaurants.\nSO, this magical evening that should have been came with a $300 bill, no apologies whatsoever, and leaving us pretty disgusted that we wasted our time and money in this place. So not the experience we thought we would have!!!!","categories":["Restaurants","Steakhouses","American (Traditional)"]}

When I got there I was told I wasn't going to see him on the first visit but was seeing his PA instead.  I thought that this wasn't a good way to represent his business but since it is his business he can operate anyway he sees fit.  His staff seemed to be 'okay' - just friendly enough to do their job.  Nothing more.  During my visit they recommended that I get an EKG. The aide administered the test and asked me if I had had a heart attack.  I said 'No'.  I then became worried.  The PA comes in and tells me that I have had a heart attack.  She said I needed additional tests.  My next appointment was scheduled 3 weeks out. Now if I had had a heart attack you would think that Dr. Labrador would have stopped by to see me on my first visit and ask me additional questions.  He didn't.  You would have thought maybe he would have called me within those 3 weeks and said something to the effect of, \"I've got you scheduled for another EKG or a stress test and that you need to go to Dr So and So\".  I never heard one word from him about my 'heart attack'.  The level of care at his office is non-existent.  It seemed like he didn't care about me at all except to collect the $400 for this office visit.  Also - don't waste your time transferring records from his office to your new doctor's office.  He writes the new doctor notes that the 'new' doctor won't tell me what he has written.","categories":["Health & Medical","Family Practice","Doctors"]}

They assured me that they could recover it and would tell me what was possible once they got to drive. I sent them the drive it took them four days before they looked at it. When they finally sent me a file list it was simply a bunch of numbered files there was no names and you could not preview any of them to see if it was any of the data you actually wanted. My entire children's last 10 years was lost and I was hoping to get it back. On the phone they quoted me $300 to $500 once the file list came it was $800. I asked them if they could preview a few of the photo files to guarantee that I was at least getting some amount of what I was trying to recover back. They said they would and the rep James said the techs had reviewed the files and many of the pictures opened. When I finally got the data back from them it was a bunch of album art that had been left over from my iTunes files and not one picture of my children that was not corrupt. There were dozens of files that would not open as well, I assume this was to make my file list look longer.

We showed up promptly for our reservation, however, we were seated in what appeared to be a waiting room for approximately 20 minutes.\n\nFinally, our name was called, and we were brought to a nicely appointed table near the front. After about another ten minutes, we were asked if we wanted to order drinks, which we did. After the drinks came, we attempted to flag our waiters twice to order our soups and main dishs, finally putting in our main order at around 8:35. We both ordered the garlic soup, which came out relatively quickly and was very tasty.  Subsequently, however, we proceeded to wait no less than an hour until our waiter told us that our dishes would be out shortly, providing no explanation for the indecipherable delay. Around another 15 minutes after that, the dishes finally came- mind you at this point we had been in the restaurant for almost 2 hours.  We ordered the lamb and the red snapper, albeit small dishes that did have nice taste profiles to be fair. \n\nAfter finishing our meals, the waiter asked if we wanted dessert. Given the aforementioned delays, we asked given the time constraints whether the king cake, the dessert we wanted to order, would also take a long time to prepare. We were assured that it wouldn't, When the king cake came out in a timely fashion, to be fair, it resembled nothing in either taste nor appearance to king cake. That would have been okay, except the dessert was subpar- tasting like a crossaint with chocolate mousse and banana, with no decipherable resemblance to kind cake. Very disappointing to say the least . Additionally, the couple beside us, who showed up no less than 45 minutes after we did, got their main dish at the same time that e got ours.  Moreover, the couple directly next to us each had to send their respective dishes back to the kitchen for rectification. \n\nIn totality, we attempted to make the best of the situation, but it put a damper on the last night of our honeymoon. Additionally, given the price point of the meal ($175 before tip) it was the worst \"fine dining\" experience we've had.

They also started to become unnecessarily stingy. I.E. I like to order their BBQ chicken quesadilla and I like to dip it in their BBQ sauce. Well they charge extra for a container of sauce. It's not the price that bothers me since I can afford to eat out, it's the feeling that they've become progressively stingier. I understand charging extra if you ask for multiple extra sauce or dressing, but come on the first one should be included. I find their salads to be \"under-dressed\", which is fine for some, but at any other place they will happily give you extra dressing. Here? Nah you gotta leave the table and give them money. I'm probably going to start eating here less and try other places (hint: your competitors next door don't charge extra for sauce\/dressing either).","categories":["Korean","Restaurants","Barbeque","Mexican","Gluten-Free","Salad","Soup","Vegetarian","Vegan"]}

So I ask why isn't it included if its recommended and what is included for $519?  Call #3 comes at approximately 3:00..  Car done? She asks \"if we run into tomorrow morning is that ok?\"  I say sure, we just need to coordinate the exchange ( I only go there because they valet).  Call # 4 comes in the next day at 3:30.  This is morning?  But the kicker comes when I find out the mats did not come with the detailing.  Perhaps I did misunderstand her initially, but I wouldn't have gotten the detail at all if I had known.  The offered to split the mats with me, but as I really didn't need them to begin with, I figured I'd save the $40.

I wish I had taken pictures to share here, but honestly I never want to see the inside of this place again.\n\nI called and asked if I could come by for a walk-thru (without my dog) to see how the facility was, personnel on the phone was quiet, but polite. Not a problem.  Easy enough to get there too.\n\nI arrived at Boise Kennels, a little surprised that it is actually someone's house. I was a little hesitant at first, but decided that I may be wrong about my gut feeling and walked into their office anyway. This was red flag number one. As soon as I walked into their office a horrifically strong odor of ammonia- a chemical in bleach and in urine that has been left to sit too long. I'm not saying this was a \"nice, clean\" waft, it was downright pungent. The owner introduced himself, showed me the outdoor area (which is failry nice, to be honest), and then led me back into the office to see the actual kennels.\n\nI'm not kidding when I say my immediate thought was \"oh my G**... the mold\". Seriously- red flag number two. I peered down a long, very, VERY dark hallway lined on the walls with minuscule chain link\/soggy plywood crates. The owner walked me down the hallway past all of these cages (the bedding inside appeared clean at first glance, I didn't want to get to close to inspect otherwise). Some dogs had huge scrapes on the bridges of their noses- I assume from sticking their nose through the chain linked fencing that makes up the door to the cages.\n\nFor the larger \"families\" of dogs, they have a chain-linked caged room with a door similar to what you'd see walking through one of those haunted mansions- the kind like in an old prison where they keep someone in a straight-jacket (without the padding, of course) and have a small barred window to monitor them. The \"rooms\" seemed to be the size of a large bath tub with 2-4 large breed dogs in them. They're small and the dogs are in there for a majority of their stay. The owner said that for an extra price each day, he lets them out for about 30 minutes in the grassy area. All told, the owner says they spend 2 hours outside of their holes.\n\nTheir outdoor time kennels are under a corrugated metal roof. Dark, damp, concrete or packed dirt flooring. The kennels are narrow and short and stacked right next to each other. I can't imagine my dog being in a place like this- there's absolutely no way I would recommend this place ton ANYONE just based on the conditions these dogs endure.\n\nI implore you. Visit ANY facility before you reserve a boarding. Don't know if my review is realistic? Visit them. Walk through their facility and make your own judgement call. This was my experience and it was so bad.\n\nMaybe the workers care, maybe they don't- but as far as the management goes, I can only make assumptions based on the appearance of the kennels. It's a cheap place to bring your dog, sure, but its absolutely not worth risking your dog's health to save a couple bucks.","categories":["Pet Sitting","Dog Walkers","Pet Training","Pets","Pet Groomers","Pet Boarding","Pet Services"]}

I complained and she said, \"sorry we're busy.\" I said we didn't need that time and we could have come another day if you were busy. We went for our first time to another place a month ago. We wanted to try another place because of poor communication and unhappy results with their nails. After what we had today we would gladly return to the first place. One of my girls nails were still in great condition but they told her she needed a new \"full set\" and ripped her nails off which was very painful and charged her $10 more than the others. The man who did my other two girls dropped the nail file, got a new one and begin to file his own nails both times. For one daughter he kept hitting her skin and was painful. This place was too crowded! An hour and a half is entirely WAY TOO LONG to sit in a waiting room ESPECIALLY during a pandemic. I would have NEVER LEFT MY CHILDREN if I knew they would be sitting there so long. And they would have never been exposed to the man who came in screaming at the top of his lungs right next to my children without a mask.  And he scared the crap out of one of them. 15 minutes of exposure is all it takes or less.\nOne positive were the dividers between the nail professional, client and neighboring clients.

However, they did not provide all of us with menus, even after specific requests. As the meal went on it became increasingly difficult to get either of the two waiters to help us. One of our party who wanted to order an entree they'd run out of was repeatedly pressured by the waitress to then order the most expensive thing on the menu until she gave in (even after she told the waitress that it was point blank too expensive for her). Upon the completion of our meals, several members of our party had to ask for their checks more than 5 times before they were helped. And the absolutely asinine insult to injury was when the waiter hand wrote in everyone's tip for them and rounded well over 20%. When I asked for the manager he told me he was the manager, so I explained that the bloated gratuity in light of the immensely subpar service we received was rather questionable and out of line. His response? To defensively exclaim that this was their policy and he wasn't changing it before walking away in a huff.

Then dinner entree came, and my roasted chicken (allegedly marinated and seasoned with spices including but not limited to lemongrass) was drier than beef jerky. It was more like deep fried, which last I check isn't the same as roasted. How dry is dry you asked... let's just say the drumstick had no meat on it because the meat got fried away. I tried... I tried to eat it and I think I almost broke my teeth trying to chew the meat. AND it had no flavor.\nI am not the kind to complain and to return food but I just couldn't eat this. It's not edible. And from the look of the waitress I knew this wasn't going to end well.  Next up we got paid a visit from the \"chef\" (I am guessing also owner\/manager), who angrily asked who ordered the chicken because obviously whoever ordered it didn't know anything about Gai Yang (aka my roasted chicken dish's name in Thai). When I identified myself as the person who ordered the dish, she stared at me and asked if I have ever eaten Gai Yang before because it's fried. Yes I have had Gai Yang, not at this place, but many Thai places around the world. If it is fried it was flash fried and never dry as a bone.

{"stars":1,"text":"In my search for the perfect rolling backpack for an international trip I ordered two backpacks online and had them delivered to the store. At the encouragement of my husband I also paid for a membership. The backpacks were estimated to arrive a couple weeks after I placed the order. \n\nAbout a week into the wait I thought, \"Hm. That's weird. I never received a welcome email for my membership or any notification that my order was received.\" I called the corporate number and they told me that I had entered my email incorrectly when I signed up. Okay, cool. I take responsibility for that. When they changed my email to the correct one I still did not receive a welcome email or any notifications in my regular inbox or junk folder about my order. \n\nThe day the store was supposed to receive the backpacks came and went. No phone call. No email notification. I called the store. After lots of confusion on the sales associate's part (including comments like, \"I'm not sure why it says they haven't shipped\" and \"Oh, it says this order was partially filled\"), they located the bags and told me I could pick them up. Oh, great, I thought. I will stop by next week when the craziness of school and work has settled down. \n\nA little more than a week later I stop by the store and again there is massive confusion about where my backpacks are. The sales associate who finally looked up the order said, \"Your order has been canceled.\" Turns out, the one email I got from PayPal (not REI) said that I didn't actually pay for them and that REI would collect payment when I came in to pick them up. Again, my fault for assuming that I had paid in full for the backpacks and they were just waiting for me to go get them.\n\nAnother sales associate (who at various times is also casually eating an energy bar or something while trying to help the first one) comes up to see if they are somewhere on the floor and finds just one of the backpacks I originally ordered plus the same bag in a different color. Resignedly I say that I will take the other color and when the sales associate rings it up, it is almost 190.00 MORE than the first bag, which is on clearance. \n\nFrom beginning to end the whole ordeal has been a disaster of miscommunication and on top of it they are asking me to pay 190.00 more than what I had intended to pay for a situation that is not my fault. I ask if they can honor the price of my original order and the associate radios Brad the \"manager\" (and I use this word loosely) to explain the situation and ask for the price adjustment. \n\nBrad simply says, \"Nope.\" Or maybe he didn't say that. Maybe he said, \"F off\" or \"Oh, hell naw\" or \"Pssshaaah!\" I can only guess because Brad, in his role as \"manager,\" never came to me to apologize for the mix up or try to make it right. In fact, as I was surrounded by three sales associates (the one who helped me, the masticating one who found the backpacks, and another who had to figure out how to refund the cost of my membership), Brad walked by, saw that I was unhappy by the look on my face (which, by the way, I am proud to say I did NOT take out on anyone in the store - although I totally understand why there is yelling, fit-throwing and general rage from other people in situations like this), LOOKED ME UP AND DOWN, gave me the side eye, then passed the whole situation by. \n\nThis made me instantly realize that I was not being treated as your typical REI shopper. Maybe I should have thrown a fit. Maybe I needed to look like I just rappelled off a mountain to get stellar service. Maybe I should have insisted. But it's not my job as a consumer who was failed by a company to make it right. The sales associates were nice enough but Brad didn't stick around long enough to have that conversation. As I was waiting for the associates to figure out how to refund my membership payment, I told them, \"This whole thing could have been avoided if I received a phone call or an email from the store to let me know 1. That my backpacks had come in, 2. That my order had been canceled and\/or 3. That my backpacks were being put back on the shelf.\" The only response I received was, \"Yyyeeeeeaaaaahhhh..... Sometimes we call people and sometimes we don't, so..... Sorry.\"\n\nAt no point while I was in the store did anyone try to convince me to keep my membership or offer a solution about how to make it right. I called the Corporate office to complain about Brad and the entire debacle and even they could not honor the price I originally paid for the backpack that went missing. At best, they said they would communicate with Boise about my treatment in the store and offer a 30% discount on any full price backpack I did buy - which doesn't even begin to the touch the cost I would have originally paid for the backpacks I found online.\n\nThis is the worst retail experience I have ever had. And I have been to Walmart in Florida! I will never shop at REI again and I will actively encourage my friends and family to never shop there.","categories":["Fashion","Outdoor Gear","Bikes","Sporting Goods","Sports Wear","Shopping"]}

{"stars":2,"text":"Yep, been back here a few times since my first review and none of my experiences have been wondrous, stellar or even a-okay.\n\n(I am about to use an old, grammatically bad Philly expression from my youth...the 'positive anymore') Anymore, Spice Finch has added a weekday lunch to their other dining time slots. On top of that, in addition to the regular lunch menu, they offer an 'express' deal-$17 for one sauce + one accompaniment + one sandwich or salad. Spice Finch has so many great reviews, it felt like I just needed to try it one more time. There I go again, ignoring my intuition. Other reviews be damned!\n\nWhen I arrived at 1 p.m., I was the only diner in the place and when I left at a bit after 2, that was still the case. Before I get into my food experience, let me say that service was fine. Not overly cordial but prompt and professional.  \n\nI did go for the express lunch and started with the crudites and muhumara sauce. The muhumara was under spiced and way too chunky for some of the vegetable scoopers-specifically the runner beans and the halved cherry tomatoes. It also came with dip appropriate, lovely, mild watermelon radishes and sliced Persian cukes. I wound up dumping the sauce into the veggies and then adding them to my sandwich when it came. \n\nAlso ordered a cocktail called Two and the Four which is snap pea infused vodka, mint, lemon. Of course, as always happens to me, it was served in one of those frou frou coupe glasses that I despise. If I knew that in advance, I'd have ordered something else instead. It was mildly vegetal and refreshing but the purple aster, floating in it like Ophelia, did nothing for the drink. Why not just garnish with a mint sprig or lemon slice? I declined a second cocktail but was happy that one was offered. \n\nMy main course was chili chicken flatbread-garlic yogurt, tahini, lettuce, tomato, cucumber, according to the menu, and a side of fries. They were hard and not especially good and came with no dipping sauce or even ketchup. \n\nThis 'flat bread' description confused me. When it was served, it looked like a giant bao. It was folded in half and stuck closed with a wooden pick. No idea where the 'chili' part came in. The sandwich, which is about the best way to describe this, was too sloppy to pick up and eat, so I took the pick out of it, threw in my muhumara'd vegetables and ate it with a fork and knife. It was more like pita bread than anything else. Some of the chicken in it (white meat) was moist, some was dry. None of the pieces had much flavor. I was pleased with myself for having saved the muhumara, even though that was not spiced in any discernible way, either. There was a white sauce in the mix, but if that was garlic yogurt or even tahini, I'm Karamo Brown of the Fab Five. The only honest positive thing I can say for this menu item is that it was filling. \n\nThere was depressing electronic background music that might be perfect for when the space is full and buzzing with conversation, but sitting as a singleton diner in an empty restaurant with my New Yorker and my disappointing food, the robotic elevator music just heightened the bad vibes of my lunch and made me consider slitting my wrists. \n\nDessert was offered and it occurred to me that this would be the saving grace of the meal and this visit to Spice Finch. Wrong. Again. \n\nI'd ordered Burnt Cream which was toasted cold cream, rose syrup, fresh berries. What I got was a frozen hockey puck of something off white that had black and brown scorch bubbles on the top which tasted like nothing. The stuff was frozen so hard I could not break through it with my dessert spoon so I had to sit there, hoping it would soften up enough that it would not fly off my plate the second or third time I tried to get a scoop. It was in a watery pink puddle of what I guess was the rosewater. That goop neither smelled or tasted of rose. It was just sugary simple syrup. The fruit garnish-black berries, raspberries and strawberries-was very ripe, lovely and fresh. I would have been happy with them and a side of unsweetened whipped cream for afters. The frozen puck finally got a bit softer and when I took a taste, it was like eating a very chemically flavored citrus yogurt. Thank god for those berries. I pushed the dish away and left everything else on it to melt into bad tasting oblivion. \n\nAfter 4 separate visits here, either I have never chosen the 'right' dishes or else they don't exist and Spice Finch suffers from a serious case of the Emperor's New Clothes. \n\nDecide for yourself. I will not be going back for love or money.","categories":["Breakfast & Brunch","Restaurants","Mediterranean"]}

When she asked what flavor cream cheeses were available the rude young employee pointed to the menu and told her all the flavors were up there .... We couldn't find them after careful scrutiny! As we tried to enjoy our meal we were subjected to loud hooting and carrying on of the employees while they were working!  It felt like the lunatics had control of the asylum .

He didn't have much knowledge about wine. My suggestion to help fix this issue would be to have a small description of the wine, not just the name and vintage. Not everyone knows what a 2013 Chardonnay from Burgundy France is going to taste like. (Just using that as an example). \n\n\nRoughly an hour later our entrees came. 2 of us ordered street tacos and the other 2 had the meatloaf. Street tacos were large portions, but the pork had a horrible texture and the flavors just didn't balance well. I ate only a few bites and left the rest behind. The 2 that ordered the meatloaf ate the veggies and potatoes but left the rock hard and extremely dry meatloaf behind. The gravy\/sauce on the meatloaf was awfully salty too.\n\nOur server asked if everything was ok and we all politely told him our contentions. He offered a dessert menu, which we declined and brought us our bill.\n\nExtremely disappointing meal from beginning to end.

Couple of examples enforcement of the quite hours of your not going to enforce them why have them? We have called numerous when people are partying on after the quite hours but not lowering the tone, same letting their kids run around jumping and stuff after the quite hours. We get the same answer okay we will take care of it and they never do! Another example a bunch of kids we're staying here for some younger kids hockey tournament they we're running around in the halls playing street hockey hitting the ball of the walls and stuff and even in their rooms we called at least three times first two times they said they would look into it they didn't then the other time the lady at the front desk says to me well there's bad weather outside what are they supposed to do? I said really how about doing your job and telling their parents to have their kids settle down and stop playing hockey in the dang hallway not only because they might break something or how about for the safety for your other guest before someone walks off the elevator and gets smacked in the head with the ball? Another thing is when you reserve the gym an example just last night I around 930 pm I asked the desk to reserve the gym for 6 am this morning she said no problem I'll put it down my wife because of work 6 am is the best time for her to get exercise in. Anyway, this morning my wife goes down to exercise goes to the desk so they could let her and the lady at the front desk says you can't someone else reserved the room my wife says what do you mean we reserved it yesterday. It's now like 618 in the morning and their is no one in the room and they still told her no. I call down to the front desk said I talked to them last night they said they are putting it down the lady at the front desk says she wasn't the person working at that time and that they didn't put it down or leave a note saying someone reserved it.

The Friday afternoon check in girl, also our Tuesday afternoon check out person, was the only nicest person. We learned this is a spotty area known for crime, murder, prostitution, and shootings. While the hotel may have been renovated, it was musty and smelled smokey despite being nonsmoking. We could see a leak above the shower. The floors seem wet in the room. The vending machine and ice makers weren't working. It was frickin hot and humid here during our late May stay. Too much bad to point out. Still shaking my head at the airport. \n\nHighlight - free breakfast every morning and flavored creamer. Felt bad for the cook because he serviced the entire hotel by himself, with a group of 40 a few days. Completely inefficient way to handle this, as well as getting any toiletries and towel service. \n\nI cannot fathom how they got their rating of anything above 3 and below.

We waited 40 minutes for our drinks, 2 tequilas and a beer. The quest fundido took an additional 30 minutes, so over an hour wait for our cheese dip to arrive. The tacos followed the cheese about 20 minutes later. We're now at an hour and a half. Meanwhile, tables that arrived after us got drinks in a jiffy and apps not long after ordering. We felt like we were invisible. Our server never scanned the room, so trying to get another round was frustrating. Overall the food was good, but the service was abysmal. Thst ruined the entire experience.While I will give it one more chance sometime in the future, there's a new taco joint around the corner that has great service and a bigger menu. While I like the more intimate atmosphere of Sangrita, we received some of the worst table service ever. The server said that the kitchen was backed up, but the place wasn't near full. And that doesn't explain the super slow bar service either. I give it 1 star for service and 4 for the food. I rounded down on principle. The manager never walked the floor to ask how things were.

We were charged for a manicure which my daughter and I specifically told them we only wanted her nails and toes painted.  She doesn't like all the other stuff.  So when I went to check out I used my coupon that was on my phone.  They wanted a picture of my phone with coupon and a picture of my ID.  I thought this was absolutely ridiculous and I wasn't giving them a picture of my ID.  This was all being yelled from a work station to the lady at the front desk.  I was so absolutely embarrassed.

{"stars":1,"text":"My complaint is a combination of terrible customer service and billing issues. Unfortunately, my area currently is providing only one provider option for internet services. I do not require television, so a \"bundle\" is not feasible due to it costing more monthly and overall within a contract period. I have had Comcast for a little over a year. I signed up for a year subscription. Did not opt out of paper billing. For whatever reason have not received a paper bill since November 2017. I typically pay online regardless. I recently received a much higher bill than usual. I called the customer loyalty phone number to inquire and try to rectify the issue on 3 separate occasions and was not assisted. I was met with disdain, fault, and attitude especially the third call. All 3 employees refused to let me speak to a supervisor. I have had comcast years past and they were very helpful at that point in time, so we renewed with them. This time, however, I am disgusted by the work ethic and customer service provided by their 3 employees in their customer loyalty section, especially the third employee. I did give the third gentleman attitude in return and cancelled my service completely. I fully understand that due to Comcast currently monopolizing my area my only other option is to not have any internet service. I am not happy about this, but it is better than supporting Comcast and their business practices. Please deal with this ridiculous and atrocious company so that no other customer will have to experience this. I will sign up with another company once they break Comcast's hold on my area even if they cost more. The only way I might ever consider Comcast is if they rectified this situation, including my higher costing bill, and provide a feasible service and cost rate. Otherwise, I can wholeheartedly say I do not recommend this company to anyone.","categories":["Internet Service Providers","Professional Services","Home Services","Landmarks & Historical Buildings","Public Services & Government"]}

{"stars":2,"text":"No es bueno.\n\nPhew! And i thought taking 6 years of spanish was all for nothing!\n\nHaving worked in Deleware for the past year, 2 places pop up quite frequently, Grotto and La Tolteca. You cant travel more than a mole anywhere in The First State, without running into one, the other, or both. I had already tried Grotto, but La Tolteca had long been on my list. After years of eating faux mexican cuisine such as Taco Bell, Chillis and On The Border, I was anxious to try \"authentic\" mexican food.\n\nSo keep the fact that Ive never had real mexican food in mind, as you read my review. Even though I love being an asshole, I hate giving bad reviews, but I really was disappointed by La Tolteca. First the good...\n\nThe decor is awesome, from the colored tilework to the outrageous paintings ( one was a Napoleon Dynamite inspired shot, of an eagle eating a snake). I also like that the entire staff seemed like real mexicans. Call me racist, but I like my ethnic restraunts to be run by people of that ethnicity.  Forgive me if I dont want my fajitas served to me by Amber or Troy. Sadly, the good things I can say about La Tolteca, ends there.\n\nGood atmosphere and service can only get you so far. If the food is terrible, theres no point.  Id eat food from Sycamore, while sitting in a dumpster, served by neo nazis than eat a bad meal in a great place. The food at Tolteca wasnt THAT bad, but it wasnt good.\n\nAgain, I know not from authentic Mexican food, but the chips and salsa were average, drinks were weak (even the ginger ale), and the food failed to impress me and my family. 3 of us got the beef fajitas, one of them being my daughter, who was trying them for the first time. Fajitas were my wife and I's favorite meal, earlier in our relationship and weve tried them at a few places ( Chilis being the best, believe it or not) These happened to be the worst.\n\n  I feel like the guac was frozen. When even Ruby Tuesday is making fresh to order guac, this is unforgivable (I may be wrong, but it seemed cold). The Fajitas were burried under veggies that I really dont even associate with Fajitas. The onion and peppers were OK, but mushrooms and tomatoes were too much. It would have been Ok if the meat was good, but it was bland and tough. I got a good taste of the beef because...\n\n ...They only gave 2 tortillas! And to order more would have cost extra $$$!! Not only was it just 2 tortillas, but they served them in a crumpled piece of aluminum, where the tortilla on the outside was burned and the one on the inside was cold. Also...No cheese!!!! It wasnt a mistake..none of us , who ordered fajitas got any.\n\nNow, im waiting for someone to tell me that this is how its done in Mexico, and if thats the case, La Tolteca is doing it right. However, Montezumas Revenge is also something authentically mexican, it doesnt mean I want it.  \n\nMy sister and her BF got sampler platters and they liked it, but werent really impressed. They both said theyve had better. The only one who was really satisfied with his meal was my son...who had the chicken nuggets and fries. He thought they were great, and said that he, \" likes mexican food!\" \n\nI forgot that we all liked the Churros, for dessert. So in summation, go there for desert and atmosphere. Id also say it was a little pricey, for mexican food, especially when it was crummy. Honestly, if the chain mexican food is wrong, I dont want to be right. As far as im concerned, La Tolteca is mexi-cant.","categories":["Latin American","Mexican","Restaurants","Tex-Mex"]}

This is how you can tell that most of the positive reviews are for other restaurants - they are mis-placed and does not give an accurate assessment of Szechuan Express on City Avenue in Bala Cynwyd.  \n\nThe reality is Several Years ago, the food was (at best) decent, eatable, moderately priced, and served with a smile. In 2019 the quality of the food diminished. Most dishes are poorly prepared - simply thrown together,\nthe meats, and or shrimp is not quality fresh, and for unknown reasons, prices have increased.\n\n Just yesterday 7\/16\/2021 in a rush, I ordered small order of chicken wings, and a small order of pork fried rice. The chicken was obviously from a frozen bag, it was tough, and brutally cooked. Portions of the fried rice was brittle, hard as if it had been re-cooked from a previous order that did not sell. The 2 small orders cost $14.00. Two to three bites and the rice and 1 chicken wingette, and both orders went in the trash.\n\nIt GRIEVES me that I forgot why we stopped ordering from this place. The reality is Szechauan Express will continue to serve Sub Standard, not fresh, poorly prepared food, if people continue to pay for their type of Garbage. My heart goes out to people who never experienced truly quality fresh Asian dishes prepared with love and executed with the skills of excellence.

Latin's Hand never informed me that the package was returned to them. I had to track it all through UPS on my own. Then I asked if it would be reshipped. Was told the person who does the shipping isnt there and to call back. I called back. Shipped person not working. (For some reason, nobody who works there is able to take a message. They REFUSE to take messages.) When I finally got someone on the phone who knows about shipping, they said they would check on it -- never heard back. A week later, the hammock arrives -- but arrives WITHOUT the installation kit that I also paid for. Called again to find out what happened -- was told I would receive  call back. Never got a call back. Called again, was told the person in charge wasnt working. Again, the person who answers the phone WILL NOT take a message. (???)

{"stars":1,"text":"EXTREMELY pushy sales people. I was mowing the lawn and was approached by someone unsolicited. He said it would be an easy and free estimate, so I thought fine. I couldn't schedule an appointment that day, so I said I'd call and set something up. They called me every single day (during work hours) for 3 weeks afterwards. I finally figured I'd at least take the free quote but they wouldn't allow us to schedule an appointment without my spouse and I both being present, and now I understand why. The appointment started at 6:30pm, and the sales person did not leave our home until 12:45AM THE NEXT DAY. They didn't even give us a quote until 4 hours in because they have to go through an entire song and dance of a show. They don't give actual information about the products, so you can't compare. They show you their own comparisons, but anyone knows how companies only use the numbers that help them. The starting quote for 10 base level standard windows was $16,000 and finally (after 3 different price reductions) their quote  came down to more than $5,000 for 6. And that quote was ONLY if we signed that day before they left (hence why both home owners had to be there). It was not itemized so we didn't know what they were charging for product vs. labor. It also did not include any ratings for the windows, so we couldn't even look up to know the type of \"high end\" product that was supposed to be so fantastic. After they left, I spoke with a contractor friend, and he told us the job could be done for half the price they gave us. Needless to say, we did not agree to have them do the work on our house.

The swordfish was tasty, slightly over cooked, but the squash that it came with was nearly inedible salty. The burger was good - nothing to write home about, but it was a burger after all.

{"stars":1,"text":"I've bought and sold many classic cars in my life. I understand that they can have some hidden issues. I've been around, I expect it. However, what I experienced with St. Louis Car Museum was just plain ridiculous and they should be ashamed. I purchased a '62 Triumph TR3B from them 6 weeks ago for $39,000 (plus transport). Definitely top dollar for this make and model car.Over the phone they told me that the car had been restored several years earlier and was in excellent condition. I asked plenty of questions about the car. I had explained that I was looking for a car that my teenage son could drive once in a while. I was assured that the car was in great working order and was a great investment.\n\nWe received the car via transport and visually it was a \"7\" when we were expecting a \"9\". OK, like I said, I've bought plenty of classics and some people's definition of \"excellent condition\" is different than others. This did not sway our excitement. Heck, we could fix the little paint scratches and interior rip that St. Louis neglected to photograph or disclose. We could even overlook the fact that it wouldn't start without the transport driver spraying gas into the carburetor. So off my son and I went on our first drive... \n\nWithin the first 1\/4 mile...\n- The driver's side door repeatedly opened all by itself. I couldn't get it to stay latched.\n- The car couldn't drive in a straight line, every bump sent it in a different direction.\n- At the 1st traffic light I pressed the brakes and THE PEDAL WENT TO THE FLOOR, BRAKES DIDN'T WORK and we rolled into the middle of the intersection. I tried honking the horn to worn on coming traffic but, THE HORN DIDN'T WORK.\n- I learned from the driver behind me, (who stopped to make sure we were ok) that the brake lights didn't work.\n- I towed it to the local British car mechanic. While we were there the mechanic asked me to start the car so he could give the car a general look. AFTER 5 MINUTES OF IDLING THE RADIATOR BLEW. The mechanic showed me where there was a large mound of JB Weld stuck to the, very old and un-restored, radiator where someone attempted to hide the radiator's crack near the cap stem. \nHe asked me how much I paid for the car. He was shocked considering the condition it was in. \n\nI called St. Louis Car Museum and they refused to take the car back. They told me to have it repaired and they would reimburse me. Reluctantly I agreed. The repairs took two weeks and came to over $4700 (to replace the radiator they had to take the front nose of the car off, The entire brake line and caliper system was decrepit and the electrical issues were numerous). When I submitted the invoice, St. Louis Museum refused to pay the amount. They told me all they would give me is $1000.\n\nThis car could have killed my son and I. St Louis Car Museum couldn't have cared less that they sold someone a vehicle that endangered their lives because they didn't perform the most basic of safety and drive-ability tests. Let's put the life threatening issues aside. This car is nowhere near the condition they described and charged us for. The pictures looked great... They talked a great story...But when it came time to stand behind the totally dysfunctional product they sold us, they turned their back on us.\n\nAfter 6 weeks we now have a mere 15 miles on the car since it was delivered. And, oh yeah, now the water pump just went out and it's back in the shop. AGAIN. \n\nI've never written a review of any kind but this was just too much.","categories":["Car Dealers","Auto Repair","Used Car Dealers","Car Buyers","Automotive","Museums","Arts & Entertainment"]}

{"stars":1,"text":"WOULD NEVER EVER RETURN! Terrible Terrible Terrible Service and Food is only So So, with small portions! \n\nHow BAD is the service? I had to get up from our table twice to ask for someone to take our order. - The second time, I asked the busboy if he would please take our order. He didn't. We waited another 5 minutes until a older man bothered (waiter?\/Owner?) to stop by to take our order. - Our beverages, besides water, came almost 1 hour after we were seated. My mashed potatoes were cold by the time they brought the salt and pepper. The bread came well after our meal was served which was about 1 hour ~30 minutes after were were seated. (We asked for it 3 times.) \n\nWe should have left well before we ordered, but didn't. We should have read the reviews about the service, but didn't. Shame on us for having wasted 2 hours and ~15 minutes trying to have dinner for 3 people, when it was obvious that the entire patio area, which was 90% full, was really only being maned by one waiter. - That waiter stopped by our table once, rushed through taking our order, and never returned.  The entire staff treated us like the proverbial \"red headed step child\".\n\nThe management at this restaurant has no idea how to delegate or train the staff.  Supposedly a waitress didn't show up, but since poor service seems to be chronic, based on many Yelp reviews, I'd say this is standard service at this restaurant.  No one, and I mean no one, would take our order, stop by our table or even provide basic condiments unless we tracked them down and asked for the items or asked for service repeatedly.  i.e. A busboy would or could not do ANYTHING but take our plates away. No one could get a waiter to us in a reasonable amount of time and it seemed like if you were closer to the kitchen\/service area the more likely it was that anyone would pay any attention to you and if you were further away you were in \"No Mans Land\" were you were least likely to be served...  - One would think that staff would be directed to provide more service in such circumstances, and may even be trained for it, but at this establishment it was as if you were forbidden from doing anything but preforming certain services. If not, no one was willing to help you. I am not sure which is worse. \n\nMy Mom says she would NEVER go back to this restaurant because the SERVICE is VERY POOR and the FOOD is ONLY SO SO.\n\nMy Nephew says he would NEVER go back to this restaurant because they are NOT PROFESSIONAL in any respect.\n\nI would NEVER RETURN to this restaurant because STAFF TREATED US LIKE WE WERE INVISIBLE, even when we went out of our way to track someone down to take our order or ask for service, the waiter and staff were COMPLETELY UNPROFESSIONAL and UNCONCERNED, and the FOOD WAS ONLY SO SO.\n\nIf you are looking for a nice meal with even decent service don't go to this restaurant.

{"stars":2,"text":"In short: extremely underwhelmed and annoyed.\n\nI suppose I should've expected this from the same owner that tried to pass off Old Country Gentlemen as a real restaurant (I had a hilariously awful experience there).\n\nMy wife and I decided to have a Friday night date at the new place to check it out after The Good Pie was no more. The decor was cool, and the front half feels like a classy Italian place (the back half and the bar haven't changed). We were sat at the bar right when we walked in, which was nice. \n\nUnfortunately, it took a while for the bartender to wait on us. When he eventually did, I asked him about one of the cocktails, and his response was literally \"well, there's tequila in it,\" to which I waited a few seconds more for a real answer, realized that was it, and laughed and ordered a different cocktail (I got the #37, which is an average bourbon cocktail). My wife ordered the Genepy Collins, which was a not particularly well-balanced gin-based drink). Because my wife was starving, I asked if they serve bread, to which the bartender said would be out shortly.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, we ordered entrees, which we were initially excited about. I got the duck confit with gnocchi, and my wife ordered the mussels with noodles. No bread yet. Still hungry wife, bordering on hangry.\n\nWhen they brought out the food, we both laughed a bit because the portions are TINY. The duck confit was delicious, but there were about 5-6 pieces of gnocchi and a sampling of duck. My wife was not so lucky, and her \"white wine\" sauce basically tasted like 95% vinegar. Still no bread. The bartender noticed, and said \"still no bread?\" To which we said no, and he shrugged and and said \"sorry!\" and nothing else happened.\n\nAfter waiting for another 10 minutes with empty plates and no bread, I went up to the kitchen to ask for it, and to their credit, brought some right out. It was good, served with some olive oil. At this point, we were pretty annoyed and ready to leave, and I asked for the check.\n\nOverall, for $60 for two tiny entrees with two average cocktails, we were pretty disappointed. We looked around and saw other people with original Good Pie pizzas (which they still serve) which still looked good. If you're planning on coming in spite of this review, stick with the pizza.\n\nSo basically 2\/5 stars for pretty spacey service, with too little food and less-than-impressive cocktails for $30\/person. As with any new restaurant, I'm sure there will be growing pains, but this place isn't really a new restaurant (it was the Good Pie before).

The waitress popped by once to check on us and I asked for more bread and another glass of wine. She disappeared so I ended up going to the bar myself to get my wine. I asked one of the 4 hostesses what was going  on and they said that everyone had the same complaint as me. I asked the bar tender what was happening and she said they have a high staff turnover in the kitchen. Props to her for giving me a free glass of wine. We finally got our food and the salad I waited for for an hour was wrong! Waited another 10 mins for the correct order and thankfully the waitress comped it. Had to ask for bread again! That came and we started eating. Then the waitress came back with the check to push us out! She started clearing plates and took the freaking bread back!!!!

In this case, you spend a lot of time and it isn't that much cheaper going to an experienced stylist.\n\nI spent four hours in a styling chair, an hour while the student discussed the color with a teacher.  I'd asked for my hair to be darkened for the fall.  I had some roots from summer, but I highlight, lowlight & trim regularly- every 6-8 weeks.  My hair is healthy.  I was clear in that I wasn't interested in autumn red tones because they don't work with my natural coloring.\n\nMy chair was facing into the sun so I spent the time with my eyes closed as the stylist & I discussed my daughter's birthday party & the photographer there (hence my desire to not have roots or an odd hair color).\n\nMy hair came out metallic orange- no brown & my roots still showed!  The stylist said, \"That's not what I expected.\"  When I mentioned it to the teacher he blew me off & said we'd \"Go darker next time.\"  I called immediately & they said because of their breast cancer event they couldn't fix it before my daughter's birthday party so I had to get the orange covered by a (reputable) salon stylist.  I was in tears & was lucky enough to find another salon (it cost another $100 to fix my hair).\n\nI wanted a gift card to cover the cost of what I'd had done at Paul Mitchell.  Over the next 2 weeks I spoke to 3 people who each blew me off before I was passed to Sheridan the salon owner.  She was so rude.  She told me these were students & I should expect mistakes.  Really?  She said they would have fixed it for free when they were available (which was after my party).  I told her my hair was healthy & there was no reason it wouldn't take color & she said it didn't sound like I needed them anyway.  I certainly don't- finally we agree!  \n\nAlso, I watched a stylist continue to process a girl's hair from pink to hot pink as she tried to bleach it repeatedly.

The receptionists are always very rude and dismissive, never friendly or helpful to questions\/issues. I also experienced numerous communication problems - as a new patient to Accutane, I didn't know much about the process. Dr. Redding\/the nurses didn't tell me which dosage I was supposed to be taking, so I ended up taking way less than intended for 2 weeks until I called and asked because my acne started coming back. They never told me initially that I needed a blood test before my next appointment because they never gave me a lab order. On two occasions the doctor didn't call my prescription in after my appointment, so CVS never saw the order. Then when I asked the receptionist to contact Dr. Redding so that I could get my prescription, she said she would be unable to do that and refused to present me with a solution. Only when I started to go off on her did she put a nurse on the line to help. Any time I had these issues, the receptionists told me to call the pharmacy and figure it out myself - they were never apologetic or helpful. The receptionists were completely unsympathetic and non-understanding to the whole process and made me feel very unwelcome. I found my entire experience with them extremely frustrating and I have now switched dermatologists. The few positive things about Curcio is that the office is nice, the nurses and Dr. Redding are pleasant, and they don't make you wait long in the waiting room.

What restaurant, especially a sports bar in the middle of March Madness doesn't have their place fully staffed??  \nThe Food\nStarted off the meal with fried pickles. They were pretty tasty.  They were not incredibly hot (temp) like most fried pickles that you get from everywhere else that you leave with a sore mouth because you could not wait to eat them.  This should have been a pre-curser to what was to come. All of our food came out lukewarm at best. I had some waffle fries with my Boom Boom Shrimp PoBoy sandwich, the first two were warm and good but they got colder as I ate more.  The soup that was brought was also lukewarm.  \nMy advice for what it is worth.\nKeep walking down the road. I spoke to two of the managers (after I paid for the food) and told them that they need to check the food coming out of the kitchen because it was coming out cold. They said they would but here is hoping. Could be a really neat place to dine. They need to retrain the wait staff, give happy juice to the hostesses and have the managers go to each of the tables and check on the patrons that are keeping them open.

{"stars":1,"text":"Wow!  I just wrote a scathing review about El Patron Pizza in Tampa for leaving unwanted and unwelcome fliers under the door of unsuspecting tourist here in Tampa.  I was going to use a lot of the same issues for this review of New York Pizza Grill, but now I'm not sure what to say, only to say it carefully.  I knew there was something not quite right about the greasy looking punk that was meandering in the hallway of the 4 star hotel where I am currently residing.  As soon as I saw the flier I grabbed my room key and went looking for this person.  In hindsight that was not smart, as soon as I got a look at the guy, I ran for the elevator.  Now, I am no shrinking violet, but this guy looked like he's slap his own mother.  After reading the other reviews on here, I guess I should be happy that this employee didn't turn around and attack!  My biggest issue with this business is that they litter the halls and rooms with these fliers.  They sneak into hotels, a place where you feel safe and after this, I don't.  It doesn't seem to matter where it is a 5 star hotel chain or a family run business.  I did call every one of the pizza place that do this, because I felt bad about complaining to the staff at the hotel, but after yesterdays run in with greasy guy for New York Pizza Grill, I had it.  I do not feel safe and I told management that, and the did call the police.  So, for the employee of New York Pizza Grill, if you get caught stuffing fliers under doors where you are not invited and do not belong, you are more than likely going to be arrested.  So when you are out and about making not enough to keep your car running, ask yourself if your boss will bail you out of jail.  I doubt it, they'll probably just get another less than intelligent person to litter, trespass, annoy and sometimes terrify, hotel staff and their guests.  There are numerous reasons not to eat at New York Pizza Grill, but I'm just tossing out a good reason not to work for them.","categories":["American (Traditional)","Pizza","Italian","Restaurants"]}

It was Sunday evening and the place was hard to find and very small.  There are instructions on how to order but they were not very clear. The clerk was helpful and we placed our order and given a number. It was very cool to watch them make the orders and are handed to the customer with smiles. I kept my order fairly simple and after about 15 minutes my order was ready.  The coffee ice cream was handed over in a cup and the ice cream was literally in rolls.  Very cool looking but it got old after 3 scoops with my plastic spoon.  It was pricey. Average price was $6 a cup. Now that is expensive ice cream.  No shortage though on the amount   Had to toss it after awhile. Bottom line is I still prefer good old ice cream parlour with waffles and cones.  Worth a try for the rolled experience but that's it.

The staff was fairly friendly, however it is clear that they were not the happiest to be there, but everyone has had bad days at work. When the food arrived, the crisp bean burritos had been crisped far too much. Instead of being a nice tan in color, they both arrived dark brown, borderline burnt.

Unfortunately Yelp doesn't have fractional stars or pity stars, so here we are with two.  Here's the deal:  for some strange reason, a lot of the restaurants on Oak St. aren't open at night, so this was my first choice. The prior occupant of this space was DTB, which was great and is really missed. I had some hope, but was quickly disappointed. I can look past the goofy idea of putting tomatoes on a reuben, but what does not abide is a lack of value or liquor in a drink. Jazzy Pete's lost it on both of these accounts. There are better po boys in town for a lot less than $14 (for a small 7\" no less) and they have some sort of side like chips or even a pickle. Seriously! Not even a pickle ! Even Pelican Delicatessen can manage a half bag of chips, which I'll address later perhaps. Add in the lack of a side to an overpriced po boy, was the other nail in the coffin, a non alcoholic cocktail that wasn't supposed to be that way.

The slight dilapidation only adds to the \"Old Florida turned Left-y\" charm. But their Tuesday Fresh Market is kind of dull, with about 20 vendors in their little tents lined up along the narrow sidewalks a couple blocks from the beach.\n\nIt's a small market, the kind where you can see everything in a 15 minute circuit, unless you stop to talk to vendors, most of whom are pleasantly chatty.  A few are fairly desperate for a sale, due to the uncrowded nature of this event. The handmade jewelry is nice, and fresh local eggs and goat cheese are excellent, as is a very small (non-organic, non-local) produce stand. \n\nThere's roasted nuts, and some other typical traveling carnival resale stuff. The local bread I sampled wasn't that great, and some homemade jams were above-average but overpriced ($10 for 12 oz). There's a cute little hot sauce shop. Some of the artwork was kinda pathetic, but I did see one artisan making beautiful silk scarves that would make a great gift. So it's hit or miss.\n\nThere are some excellent little restaurants along the street, and \"antique-y\" resale shops where you might spot something you never knew you needed but now just can't live without (at any price). I'm a little dubious of hot foods at a small market like this, with low attendance and unknown health & safety supervision. But there was nothing \"must-eat\" on the sidewalk, so you could always dine at one of the little restaurants, or stop at Smokin' J's BBQ on your way out of town.\n\nI agree with another reviewer that this market is a nice diversion if you're already in the vicinity, but don't make a lengthy trip for it. With more popularity and consequent greater competition and vetting of vendors, this market would improve. The venue is certainly fun.","categories":["Specialty Food","Food","Farmers Market","Shopping","Local Flavor","Street Vendors","Fruits & Veggies"]}

I provided over two dozen moving blankets for items they were loading into a pod. They didn't bring enough blankets or supplies to wrap the furniture that  was going to the apartment.

The service was good, except that there was a long wait time between our appetizer and actual meal. The frIed pickles we had for an appetizer were yummy (going down), the barbecue was not good. At all. I would have given them another try, but later that evening I developed horrid food poisoning. Which I can only assume came from the BBQ meat, due to the type of poisoning that it was. It was the only time I have ever had food poisoning, so needless to say I won't be back.","categories":["Restaurants","Breakfast & Brunch","Pubs","Southern","Bars","Nightlife"]}

The glass door on my oven broke and when I called about repairs I gave them enough information, serial and model number that they could have given me an estimate but they had to make a service call. The quote for the work was very high, too costly for an appliance of its age. But I was hit with a $100+ service fee which despite my efforts and protest they would not waive. Other appliance repair companies I called after them were able and did give me estimates that allowed me to conclude that it was not worth repairing the stove. Only use them if you are very sure that you will want them to perform the service. Otherwise stay away and call someone else.","categories":["Appliances & Repair","Heating & Air Conditioning\/HVAC","Local Services","Electricians","Shopping","Home & Garden","Appliances","Home Services"]}

I was quoted 45 mins to an hour, I waited a little over an hour and gave a call to check on the status. I was told the driver was out the door and should be arriving any second. I waited 45 MORE minutes and still nothing so I gave another call and was immediately put on hold. The driver happened to show up while I sat on hold so I decided to hang up. The containers had sauce and grease spilled all over, my boyfriends lasagna was smashed with the lid not even on all the way. His pasta was disgusting and flavorless. I ordered baked ziti which, in comparison to his food, was much better but still absolutely horrible. Nothing was hot or even remotely warm. Our garlic knots were burnt and hard as rocks. It was an all around horrible experience. Do not give this restaurant your business or waste your money.","categories":["Pizza","Restaurants"]}

Over the years we've gone back looking to purchase a new vehicle, but between their sales department and their service department, they're anything but competent. Today I went in to get work done on the rear window of our model 3 for a known issue, and the tech wouldn't do anything unless they did a diagnostics first. They wanted to charge us $150 to a diagnostic on a known issue with our car. I even tried giving him the official repair guide that Mazda produced to fix this known issue, but he wouldn't take it. He said he didn't have a way to write it down as he stood there with a service iPad. They wanted us to leave the vehicle with them overnight so they could \"diagnose the issue\" and charge us $150 before they would even start work on the problem. We live an hour away from this dealership, made an appointment, and took time off work to get there, just so they could jerk us around. I'm going to attempt the repair myself.

The restaurant vibe and staff were nice enough in the beginning, however that wasn't my feeling after an almost 3 hour (painfully slow) experience start to finish for a pretty mediocre dinner. The menu is bizarre. The rest of the table was satisfied with their food, but no one was really impressed or wowed. It was just fine.\n\nI stuck with a pretty standard burger, however it literally had no flavor. That was likely because it was overcooked, but one would have thought that with the variety of toppings, at least that would have saved it. Nope.\n\nI'm pretty sure that our waiter forgot about us halfway through the meal, and we stupidly waited around to order dessert, since we had heard the ice cream was delicious. Luckily it was good, but unfortunately that was the best part of the meal.\n\nSo, to recap, the food wasn't bad, but it definitely left a lot to desire.

The rooms here were the poor-to-passable quality you might expect from a cheap motel on the corner of town, but the management was so terribly rude that I felt compelled to warn away other potential costumers. \nUpon arriving, my party was charged an extra person fee (obviously acceptable), but then when returning for the night, I was followed back to my room by the apparent night manager who claimed he had to ensure we had the proper number of people in our room. I expressed to him, that as an unaccompanied young women, I felt uncomfortable having a stranger follow me back to my room, whatever affiliation to hotel he might have or claim to have. He ignored my discomfort, followed me to my room, then proceeded to call the room and threaten the same extra person fee that we had already paid upon our arrival.

I think common courtesy is a 'hello'.....especially in a struggling downtown area like Woodbury where businesses come and go - you would think they would do whatever they could to embrace any potential customer coming through their doors.  I am not sure how the place is set up --- as in, do people actually rent space to sell their goods and the staff takes care of business for them or what...but if that is the case, and any of their renters are reading this, I would be gravely concerned that you're losing sales due to the people that are staffing this place.  I'm giving Woodbury Antiques two stars only because there is a wide array of antiques spread through the large area - but considering they are some of the rudest staff I've encountered, I won't ever be going there again.

Someone asks about drinks..? She says \"oh wow totally forgot about your drinks\" wait another 30 minutes, get our drinks. By the way, still no one else here.

We sit at the bar and while checking out the drink menu the bartender strolls over and says all well cocktails are two for one along with most beers etc...so we order 2 whiskey and cokes. Plain and simple. Drinks get made, we drink em, and I ask for the check.(we just had the one round because we wanted to bounce around to many different places to see more of Nashville on our somewhat short stay) What do you know, when the check comes out the drinks are not two for one. Now they're only five bucks each so it's not the end of the world but I decide to say something anyway...\"I thought you said these were two for one?\" To which the bartender replies \"Oh, well those are doubles, so...\" and then just walks outside to deal with another customer. I know for sure I didn't order doubles so why the hell did I get charged for them? More then likely by checking our ID's when we ordered she noticed we were from outta state and just figured she'd take full advantage of us. While she was outside I just paid the tab, with a tip,(don't ask me why) and we left.

I never give 1 star reviews but this was worth sharing about.\n\nThe focus seemed to be to go orders and answering phones, not the seated, paying  guests in the restaurant. \nI requested the dynamite roll ($12.95) to be not fried and it literally came out with six very thin pieces, half the size of what it should have been. Most sushi places have no problem making a fried roll into a non-fried roll, but apparently this was! \nThe roll did not contain all the ingredients listed on the menu. The fish was salmon, yellowtail, and kani (crab stick), so I know it was the correct roll, but it did not have green onions. There was mainly kani instead of real fish as well.\n\nOur server never came back to check on us when my fianc\u00e9's 2 specialty rolls came. She was primarily at the host station on the other side of restaurant. She dropped off soy sauce plates right after she gave us water in the beginning and never gave us any soy sauce and never offered refills of beverages. \n\nI had to flag down another server because my fianc\u00e9 was already finished with his meal before I had received my roll. I don't know if my meal was forgotten about or what, but I shouldn't have to get up to flag a server down. There was no explanation or apology.\n\nFish was fresh, but portions were so tiny and barely any sauce or ginger given. \n\nThis was a great disappointment. For two people to order on a romantic date and one person to not even get their meal without flagging down another server is unacceptable, and especially when unnoticed by service staff. Because I was waiting while he ate his meal, I went up to host stand to ask for a house salad while I waited , which was tasty, but it should have been taken care of because of my meal not coming for another 15 minutes after he finished his meal. \n\nSuch a disappointment to what was suppose to be a celebratory date night.\nWe won't be back to dine in. \n\nFor a high of the night, the miso he got with his Island roll was delicious and that is worth getting take out for.","categories":["Restaurants","Desserts","Japanese","Ramen","Food","Sushi Bars"]}

The service works as advertised  although the bus driver that brought us back to the office didn't use good judgement in managing his bus load of passengers. He should have took control of his bus insisting on orderly conduct of passenger and kicking off passengers that still could not control their own behavior.  Even a simple radio call to the office to alert them of the state should have been performed. Because of his lack of leadership my wife and I felt unsafe and for the most part short changed in a service that could have competed with the Airports parking in price and quality. \n\nThe incident began when a couple of passengers entered the bus and began fighting over a seat, because a woman would not move her bag off the seat next to her.  The rule on the bus is everyone must sit. They were obviously drunk and smelled horrible so the fighting escalated to swearing, F you and shut up, not good discourse at each other until another customer moved herself to the front seat.  The bus driver ignored the whole incident and drove his route while they continued fighting by yelling and swearing at each other in Spanish and English.

I have worked in the service industry for 8 years, and at one time my job was to respond to Yelp reviews, so I know how bad it is to read a negative one. I also really appreciate guppy's dedication to being a sustainable part of the conshy community.\n\nThat being said, I had the worst service experience of my life tonight.\n\nMy friends and I arrived 15 minutes before the end of happy hour and sat at a high top. We asked the waiter about happy hour specials and two of us chose to order drinks. We all ordered food. We made sure to place the order for our second drink before the end of happy hour.\n\nOur food came, we ate (it was delicious), and the waiter came back a twice to ask if he could clear plates. We were still picking at a couple of things, and he eventually left us... For over an hour. Empty drinks, empty water glasses. Yes we said we were picking, but not for the next HOUR. No sign of our waiter. If he was going to leave, he could have asked to drop our check while we were still eating, and we would have understood.\n\nWe may have ordered another round of drinks or more food in that time, but eventually we just wanted the check. \n\nWe had to grab a waitress who was clearing the next table over and tell her we hadn't seen our waiter in a very long time, and  we wanted the check.\n\nShe returned with our bill, our waiter was still nowhere to be seen. We asked what happened to him and she replied he was busy with another table. I expressed how long we had been waiting, and that we would appreciate if she could compensate us in some way for the inattentive service. \n\nShe returned with the bill, having removed the cost of one of our appetizers. The bill did not reflect the cost of our happy hour drinks. Only one of four happy hour drinks total between two of us was discounted. I pointed this out, and she replied that my order of \"vodka tonic\" wasn't specific enough to be considered a happy hour \"you-call-it\" drink. \n\nAt this point I was feeling tired of arguing over the bill. I don't want to be that person, but we were feeling neglected and taken advantage of. I asked to speak to a manger, and the woman replied that she was the manager, and she had already spoken to the waiter who had been serving us. \n\nShe then condescendingly told us that after a certain time of night the table service stops. To which I replied that we should have been given our check, or told to go to the bar, if that was the case. \n\nShe went back and discounted one more of the happy hour drinks. Now two of the four drinks we had ordered during happy hour were discounted. I said that still wasn't right. We had been mindful of the time we ordered, and knew it was before happy hour was over. She then replied \"okay fine, I'll go take the TWO dollars off for you,\" in an extremely rude tone of voice.\n\nIt shouldn't have taken that much back and forth to get our accurate check. We were all feeling embarrassed and annoyed. \n\nWhen she did bring it, we asked her to split the bill between two credit cards - not 50\/50 - and told her specifically how much to charge to each card. Of course, she ended up charging the wrong amount to each card. We just signed the checks and left.\n\nAll of this was avoidable. Myself and my friends work in the service industry, and want to be gracious and understanding. Every step of our communication with the staff from the time we said we had been waiting was uncomfortable and confrontational. \n\nI am hesitant to believe the woman who helped us with our bill was the manager.

They are very casual about the tests they are running such as the blood draw and urinalysis, etc. and run tests without letting you know..but then you get hit with a charge in the several $100's!! My cat was in today to test her for hyperthyroidism. They don't bother to tell you that the bloodwork for that is double what regular bloodwork costs. I was expecting the typical $100 like I've paid for my dog...but instead they charged me $212 just for the bloodwork. I just spent $340 and have no answers as to what is ailing my cat. \n\nI can also share that my 14 year old dog was in in September to have an ear cyst removed, and have a bunch of moles removed. I dropped her off first thing in the morning as requested and was told they would call when she was out of surgery. I finally called at 1:30, after hearing nothing from the vet, and they said she was just about to go into surgery.  So she sat there for HOURS before they did the procedure! I was told to pick her up at 5:30, and let's just say she was a trainwreck! Bleeding open wounds, blood dripping from her ear where the cyst was removed, and her entire body covered with burns from the mole removals. She was in a lot of pain, and should not have been released to me in that condition. And I paid almost $500 for that! It was way too hard on her for her age. It looked like she had been burned with cigarettes all over her body,  and her ear was FULL of blood!  Some of the wounds were huge and should have been stitched. Had I known It would be so traumatic for her, I wouldn't have done the mole removals. I would expect the vet to know that, but he made it sound like it wouldn't be a big deal.   I will be finding a different vet. This vet is outrageous with their prices, and they don't give you ANY indication of what kind of charges you're accruing until you get to the counter.

While working here I saw some of the most inspired design work I have ever witnessed from any florist. Unique and beautiful. Since I have left, not one of my co-workers remains which is sad, but I decided to place an order with them anyways out of trust and loyalty. Having worked in the industry, I know how frustrating and overwhelming it can get, but the services I received were unacceptable. I spoke with Debbie and from the go she was condescending and confrontational. Apparently there was static on the line, but there was nothing I could do about that. Having ordered flowers going to Brownsburg before, which is a special courier charge, I did not think it would be a problem. She spoke to me as though I were an idiot for making such a request. After having spoke to her I have little faith in what I am going to receive, but we will find out. Sadly, this will be my last time ever ordering from McNamara--they got rid of some of their best designers and now have rude, disrespectful individuals in the role of Manager and team. If you are looking for customer service, I would stay away...Hopefully their designs will make up for their attitude...\n\nI saw what was delivered and it was HORRIBLE.

He says, \"we can fix it but you'd have to pay\" WTF admitting that they didn't explain how more damage can be made by the repair and saying that they could fix it at a cost. The whole scam to get more money for a damage that was clearly their fault. Total BS. I wouldn't go back to this place. They have no integrity and I do believe they are scamming by not fully disclosing possible damage during their repairs.

We made a single reservation and showed up at the correct time. \n\nWe had the unfortunate luck of dealing with a lady who called herself, \"Jackie Anderson\". This person was rude, aggressive and nasty. She told us that she would enforce special conditions of the Groupon not listed when we bought it. She said that we would not be able to sit together on the same lane since we were two groups of people (Two Groupons.) and further explained that she would even refuse to sit us on adjacent lanes. She explained that it was their company policy to separate us by three or four lanes to keep us from interacting. She even said that she would do this even if they had open lanes (she assured us that they didn't... and an hour later, it's evident that she was likely lying. There's several open lanes.) \n\nA few minutes later the other family arrived and I stayed back because I didn't want to lose my cool and have our kids lose out on a good time (Even though I was not interested in being here any longer.) The same lady enforced even more limitations not on the Groupon; only five bowlers at a time despite the Groupon being valid for 10 games with no limit on the number of bowlers. \n\nIt takes a lot for me to go from an introduction to quite literally hating a person but she got me there in less than five minutes. \n\nWe have been here before (with and without Groupons) but we won't be returning.

{"stars":1,"text":"First let me say that we have been coming to this restaurant for several years. We have  always gotten great food and service. We used to live less than a mile from this location, now we live in Montgomery County and travel 20 miles to go here. We used to go here twice a week when we lived closer now we only go once a week. Tonight I took my wife and daughter to the buffet for dinner. Unfortunately, we did not get to enjoy our dinner tonight, as while we were having sushi, my daughter thought that she had a piece of paper stuck to the outside bottom of her cup of water. To our horror we discovered that it was someones fortune from a cookie, inside the bottom of her glass. She had drank over half the glass at this point. Upon seeing this my daughter got sick to her stomach and went to the bathroom, where she proceeded to throw up everything she had eaten. My wife followed to help. I asked for the manager and waited for 10 minutes but he never came. I went to the front desk to ask for the manager and found him sitting on his ass behind the counter watching something on his phone with ear buds in. When I explained the situation and asked for a refund since my daughter threw up he food and my wife could not eat anything either and I had lost my appetite he refused. he said that he would refund my daughters but not ours. That it only affected her and not us. When I asked for my receipt back he refused to give it to me saying it was his. We actually had to call the police to get our receipts so I would be able to dispute the charges with my cc company. I spoke to the cc company and they were very understanding and said that they would be happy to dispute the charges and pull the money back. All this incredibly rude person would have had to do was give me my receipt or comp the meal for the disgusting water problem and it would have been over. Instead he came outside and game me more grief before the cops showed up. Even the police asked for my receipt and he refused. Another case of people in a customer service industry that do not care about their customers. My family and I will be finding a new place to go from now on. They have lost us and the rest of our family and friends as customers. So they would rather lose more than 30 loyal customers, than to fix one small issue.

The salsa that comes with your meal was also lacking.  \n\nWe ordered the bistec tacos and the steak was chewy and flavorless.  The empanadas were wrapped in a paper thin dough that was greasy and the filling was poorly seasoned.  \n\nEven all this would be OK if the prices were reasonable, but the real killer was that the prices are SO high (similar to places like Distrito and El Vez) and the food was absolutely terrible.","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}

For the past two years the service was good and we loved the atmosphere. Beer is a bit high but we ate there often twice a day for a week. We just made it down and our first meal in the evening was there. Wow, what a difference to the worst. The waitresses were in attentive, did not introduce herself, and it went down from there. \nThe high light  was always their clam chowder, it was a 9 in the past, thick and flavorful. Yesterday it was like flavored water with a few frozen potatoes. W ordered salads, the Hooters salad was good, however, we ordered grilled chicken with three of them. One salad had 4 pieces of chicken, two salads had 2 and they brought out 4 more pieces after we were finished. One salad was not made the way it was ordered so they took it back and it did not get brought back until envy one else was done eating. NO APOLOGIES, the manager did come out and say they would not charge for the slalad that was so late and wrong, but, rather than taking responsibility he just blamed the waitress. We also had ordered 2 fries with the salads that NEVER came and again no apologies.  Here is the best part, when we first sat down we asked about the fish spread advertised on the FRONT of the menu's were requested as an appetizer, the waitress said, \"Oh I don't think we have that any more\" that is what they have had locally for years. We said \"OK\" and ordered. We got our drinks and then noticed the large chalkboard behind me that again advertised \"Our famous Fish Spread\" on special. We again asked about it and rather than asking if we would still like it, she just brought some to us with saltine crackers wrapped in plastic. \nI guess it all boils down to leadership and management. The wait staff were inside laying around and very in attentive to customs. \nFinally, after we finished the fish spread the dirty dishes we left on our table until I asked some other waiter to take them. \nOverall just very sad experience for the start of our 10 day vacation.

I took my Jeep in to Hutch's to get it taken care of, and the attendant said that their \"Ultimate Wash\" for $50 would do the trick.  Less than 5 minutes later my Jeep was \"done\".  The back seat had not been touched, the cup holders were still dirty.  I drove back around to the front and asked them to please finish the job.  Again, car goes through the wash.  This time, I get in and my hands free microphone for my phone was gone.

I ordered the bacon chicken wrap, and my fianc\u00e9e ordered the BLT. - once we got out food we walked to the car to eat it. The BLT was 2 pieces of bread with a pile of bacon under the 2 slices of bread. It was as if they forgot to put the sandwich together? There was NO lettuce tomato or remoulade which was all supposed to come on the sandwich??? I ordered a bacon chicken wrap and it came with NO bacon in it? This place really needs to get it together.!!! The food was ok. The BLT, which ended up being just a plain bacon sandwich was obviously bland- although the bacon was good, nothing to go back for. We also ordered the bacon cheese fries, again kinda bland nothing epic. First impressions say a lot.

We stayed for 20-30 mins and were never once approached by anyone. We ordered a beer, two Old Fashions, and one Gin Tonic from the bar - I honestly don't think there was any liquor in any of the drinks - the G&T tasted like sprite and the Old Fashions tasted like sugar\/bitters. I'm hardly a cocktail snob, but c'mon, it's easy to detect liquor in an Old Fashioned or Gin Tonic. \n\nMy friend ordered another Old Fashioned, mentioning the last one was weak to the bartender, and watched him make it up with no alcohol. We promptly left (had already paid for the drinks we did consume at the bar). Maybe it was \"Zero-Fcks-Given Night\" at Stateside and we didn't see the sign, but it was disheartening, especially since there are cheaper\/more attentive bars within a 2-block radius. \n\nHave been there multiple times before and always thought highly of them - but this really stood out as a totally apathetic experience on the part of Stateside. Worst part is, this was the first time for two members of our group - i highly doubt they'll ever be back, even tho I'll give Stateside the benefit of the doubt in that it was an off-night.","categories":["Nightlife","Tapas\/Small Plates","American (New)","Bars","Restaurants"]}

They are priced anywhere from $9 and up. We also ordered drinks. They brought all five small plates out at once, and at this point the table was covered with food. The server then immediately asked if we wanted to order entrees. Now, I know we are in Indiana, but we can't eat that much food at once. We filled up on small plates and decided to skip entrees and head for dessert. We even asked for a dessert menu and dessert wine menu. As SOON as it became apparent that we weren't ordering entrees our server ignored us. Didn't bring a dessert menu. Barely came back to the table. He basically gave up and then lost more money on the bill. \nThe atmosphere is terrible. It's loud, boring, and plain. We had to shout to hear each other. And then throw in the jerk server. Good thing the food was good- specifically the fried oysters, chop salad, and pork belly.

{"stars":1,"text":"I honestly should have started this review two years ago when I originally got my windows tinted. I went and got all four of my rear windows and front windows tinted and then came back for the windshield. I had had a large shake in my car which they spilled all over and then half cleaned up and left it to drip throughout the whole back part of my car down the side of the seat and on the floor and when I called to complain about it, not only were they rude they just said bring it up and we'll clean it when they should have cleaned it up in the first place. Part of it actually stained my seat which I've tried to clean many times since. Now I just went up to the shop again because my windshield has tiny bubbles in it that are noticeable especially when the sun is shining down on them and the main guy (possible owner) said to me that he can't see any bubbles and why would I come back now after two years. I told him there should be a lifetime warranty and he said he saw nothing and that there's nothing they could do. He was rude to me again! After the first time I should have known not to even go back and get my windshield done after they did all four of the others and were careless. This was one of the worst experiences I've had with getting my windows tinted and I've had three cars now with tinted windows and never had an experience like this. Don't waste your time or money.

{"stars":2,"text":"I'll start by saying I bought a Groupon, which is the ONLY reason I came here to begin with. I expected better, plain and simple.\nI had an appointment at noon, was there on time and had to wait 15 minutes to be seen. Not a huge deal - I'm patient. During this 15 minutes, or anytime after that, I was not offered anything to drink, despite several other clients with beverages. A bottle of water would have been nice. I was annoyed. \nWhen it was time for me to start, the tech just came and grabbed me and sat me in the chair. The only thing he asked me was if that was the color I wanted. No smiles, no hellos, no nothing. I was plopped down in an old massage chair to begin my pedi. The chair was uncomfortable and not adjusted to my height, AT ALL (I'm 5'2\"). It took me a few minutes to find the controls and once I did, the buttons were all busted. I finally reached for it again and the tech told me that the massage chair doesn't work. Horribly uncomfortable sitting there with the pieces jabbed in my back and my neck laid half way back because the chair didn't work. I had to grab my scarf and fold it behind my neck because it hurt so bad. The massage was good, he wasn't afraid to use pressure - which I like. The quality of both my fingernails and toe nails was ridiculous. Tech missed half of my nail with most of them. I'm terrible at painting my nails and I could have done a better job. Also, there was something clearly stuck to the polish on one of my nails when he was doing my fingers. I HAD TO PULL if off myself - I know he saw it. Also, maybe this is just me, but I find it highly unprofessional to get up in the middle of a manicure (whether or not my base coat was drying) to go use the bathroom without saying a word to me. He could have waited five minutes until he finished my nails. After everything was finished up he moved me over to the UV dryer. He carried all of my stuff over there for me, but did something weird - he put my scarf on me. He tied it up and put it over my head, it was awkward, especially since we hadn't talked at all. In fact the whole experience was awkward.\nThe salon itself was done very poorly. For being located inside such a decent mall, you think it would have a better finish. Not polished at all. They didn't even bother to take the TVs off the wall to paint. This bothered me because where I was sitting during my manicure I could see behind the TV. Since it wasn't very relaxing, I was doing a lot of looking around. The whole place was half-assed. It was like putting lipstick on a pig. \nLastly, the quality sucks. It costs $20 to upgrade to shellac on just your fingers. I declined - that's ridiculous. But the really disappointing part is that that my fingernails were jacked by the next morning - I had a light day without a lot of work (no dishes, no typing, no laundry, etc.). My nails were chipped to hell and as I said before he missed polish on large parts of my nails to begin with. The whole thing was just bad. \nI have still have a Groupon for for acrylics, which I will be getting done before the end of the month. I hope that's a better experience, but I doubt it.\nI would just go somewhere else. The nail salon in walmart could do a better job at a better price. There is nothing \"spa\" like about this place.

It was sad that was the only Happy Hour beer choice, there could have been at least one more. \nThe food choices, beyond appetizers were a hamburger or a shrimp dish. We decided to order one of each, to share. The shrimp was tasty, even if the portion seemed more like an appetizer. It came with tempura string beans, which were ok. MY husband's burger was not very thick, and it was ruined by the extremely peppered bacon. Why they felt it needed that heavily peppered bacon escapes me- just bacon would have been sufficient, or a lightly peppered one. It just ruined  his meal.

That is enough to eke out a 2 star rating instead of a 1 star.\n\nHere are all the things NOT going for it:\n- Concourse D (where Delta does 90% of its traffic) is a barren wasteland for food and drink.  There is no coffee shop, just a crappy little Community Coffee stand with surly employees and zero space to dress your coffee.  There is exactly one restaurant, where you can have the privilege of paying $10 for a burger or chicken sandwich that takes 10 minutes to prepare and comes on a soggy bun with fries so greasy that they literally disintegrate when you try to pick them up.\n- The main food court outside of security has the following options: fried, pizza, fried, fried, fried, wilty salad. I'm convinced it's impossible to get a decent meal in this airport.\n- It's basically impossible to go through security here and avoid the body scanners.  Since I am an objector to the use of the scanners (both for health and security concerns)  this means that I get a pat down Every. Single.

{"stars":1,"text":"It pains me to write this review because I think every single person at Witch Hazel is warm, kind and inclusive, from the manager to the owners. My intention in publishing this is to help anyone else that is looking for a new hairstylist or interested in a balayage with my type of hair color - I am a dark brunette. \n\nMy experience: \nAfter seeing two different hairdressers, spending almost $700 and being left with hair I don't recognize, I just can't bring myself to go back. After my first experience with a hairstylist there and getting a full balayage done, I ended up with dark brown\/reddish highlights that had no dimension to them. As time passed, my highlights faded into what looked like a really bad ombre job. After my most recent experience, which was also a full balayage with a different hairstylist, I was left with some highlights that weren't fully processed and porous (especially around the money piece section of my hair) and a bottom row of highlights with a strong line of demarcation. She also added level 1 lowlights throughout my hair yet my natural hair color is a level 3 (eeek). I didn't recognize any of this at the time I was at the salon because we went with a darker toner, but as it now fades, it is evident that my hair is the opposite of a soft, natural looking balayage. \n\nMy advice: \nIf you have dark brown hair and typically get lived-in blonde highlights like me, choose a hairstylist at Witch Hazel that has worked on someone similar to you before. Check their Instagram and pinpoint several people with your natural hair color and with the type of highlights you would like. Do not take any chances because how you see yourself in the mirror day in and day out does matter and it will take a toll on you if you have hair that you want to hide from. I really wanted to call Witch Hazel my new home, but unfortunately it didn't work out.","categories":["Beauty & Spas","Hair Salons"]}

{"stars":1,"text":"Leaving my two dogs at this Petsmart was one of the worst decisions I've made. My husband and I left our two dogs here while we were in Europe for two weeks. We live near Fort Leonard Wood, so boarding options are basically nonexistent. We decided to leave them at this Petsmart. What led to the decision was the doggy day camp. They're both still puppies and have a ton of energy. We wanted them to be playing all day. We had family call and check daily to ensure everything was going smoothly. On the second day, the workers informed our family that our dog has had diarrhea. A few days later we are told she tested positive for giardia (she had a fecal test prior to coming, which was negative, so she had to have gotten infected here). They then proceeded to isolate my two dogs. Didn't have doggy care. Just had a walk a couple times of day. For two energetic puppies, this is not enough. When we called to find out when they could participate in the day camp we received lackluster responses, \"I don't know\" and \"let me get back to you\". I'm\nSorry but for $1000 I feel completely robbed and disappointed. When we went to retrieve our dogs, not a single apology. The worker actually proceeded to argue with me saying everyone was up to date on the issue and no one could possibly tell me \"I don't know\". I have never been treated in such a manner after handing over $1000. \nThe reason I wrote this is because my husband and I picked up our dogs from the Watering Bowl today and we were ensured they were playing all day through photos and videos they uploaded to Facebook daily.  Will never again consider using Petsmart services or products again.","categories":["Pet Groomers","Pet Services","Pets","Pet Sitting","Pet Training","Pet Stores"]}

Alfredo sauce was thin - very heavy on the garlic, which in itself wasn't so bad, but a substandard sauce with mushy pasta is a definite no-win situation.  Eggplant was rubbery.  Our son-in-law had a burger - way too thick to fit into his mouth (had to be cut with a knife, which was not provided until we asked another waiter since ours did not re-appear).

One of my friends ordered a sprite and when she got it, she said it tasted nothing like sprite and more like very bitter sparkling water. He took our order and we waited about 45min and when our food came my chicken was less than luke warm and tasted like it had been sitting out for the past 20min. I went to go to the bathroom when our waiter came to give out the checks and when i returned i asked him if i could get a piece of cheesecake to go and he looked like I just ruined his day.

I just wanted to grab a beer and there are 1000 other place I could have done it.  If all other 999 places are closed, you may stop in here.\n\nThe waiter finally came over and apologized as he didn't see me come in.  I was seated by a hostess so that was a failure on their part.  It was probably 10 minutes.  I asked for the beer menu and he got me the barcode to scan for that.  Mind you, there was a paper food, spirits, cocktails, and wine menu, but no beer menu... at a brewery.  I get that it's online, but still.\n\nA waitress appeared and brought me out a water.  She said she's helping out the waiter and if I need anything, let either of them know.  Great, now I can get some service. No!\n\nI peruse the online menu and inquire about one of the beers, which he says they haven't had for a while.  WTF? I figured the beer menu was online for the reason the beers change often and the mimeograph machine can't keep up with the printing.  He points to the wall with the beers on tap then tells me about a guest beer that's a citrus wheat.  I asked for a sample.\n\nHe goes up to the bar to get and he's literally like 4 feet from the taps, but the bartender is at the other end of the bar chatting up 2 ladies.  Either that or they were chattin' him up. So I waited and made eye contact with the waiter and he kinda shrugged.  I was almost at the point of screaming across the restaurant \"hey Casanova, how about looking around to see if your waitstaff needs anything.  He came over, took about 3 tickets off the printer and started getting stuff, with my sample being first.\n\nI liked the beer, so I said bring me one.  I stepped away to use the men's room and returned to my table with a nice cold beer on the table.  In walking around, I noticed there were plenty of people working at the place. I sat and enjoyed it a bit, finished it, and waited some more. Finally, the waiter appeared and came over and I just asked for the check.  He brought it over and I paid in cash as I couldn't bear to wait any more.  I was close to walking out at the beginning and in hindsight, I should have.\n\nTo the management staff and front of the house staff of which there were 4 of you hanging around the front door shooting the breeze: with like 3 tables with patrons, treat them like you're happy they are there.

When you've had great experiences like that you search to duplicate those times for the rest of your life, wherever you may live.\nOro Valley is not New York...thank goodness. But it's also not Tucson which has garnered several awards as being an up and coming gastronomic area. So when me and my friend, who's also from New York, found Grain River we were ecstatic! Great food! REALLY great!\nThe first time we went everything was beyond perfect! Lo Mein properly seasoned with plump, slightly chewey noodles, sweet and sour soup that was actually both sweet AND sour in a thick broth, crispy egg rolls full of fresh veggies, sticky rice, crispy and light tempura, moist and flavorful pork and great service...we were so happy to have found this restaurant! It seemed too good to be true!\nBecause it clearly WAS too good to be true.\nWe went a second time, this time my friend brought her husband whose birthday was a few days away. We'd chatted Grain River up to him for a few weeks. He was so happy to have his birthday dinner there after hearing our high praise. Only what we got on our second visit was a 180\u00b0 from our first.\nWatery, flavorless broth in our soup, Lo Mein that was thick and pasty, egg rolls that hadn't been cooked long enough and looked like they'd been filled with prechewed veggies...what the heck happened?!\nGrain River is also not inexpensive. Which we didn't mind on our first visit, but honestly could've purchased frozen meals that would have tasted better than our second meal.\nWe were so disappointed and my friends husbands birthday dinner was ruined.\nAt the very least, Grain River is unreliable in their quality. And I'd love to say that we'll give them a third chance, but at upwards of $17.00 for a bento plate it's just too much to gamble.\nI hope they get their act together.

I included this information in my reservation as we would be arriving late that night and wanted to ensure check in wouldn't be an issue. We were met with an unfriendly and unwelcoming front desk. Check in seemed to be inconveniencing him. We accidentally got sent with the topper to our cake and asked if they could store it in their refrigerator until my parents could pick it up the next morning. Instead of finding out if it was a possibility, he questioned us why we needed to keep the cake so badly. After explaining wedding tradition he then disappeared I guess to ask someone if it was okay. Thankfully they took it. \n\nOur room was nice, however there was what appeared to be a wine fridge that was off and warm. Our caterers had packed us leftovers from the reception, and we had no place to refrigerate our food and had to throw it out. Definitely wasn't going to ask for refrigeration again. There was a total of zero glasses or even plastic cups in the room and not even an expensive bottle of water to purchase. We literally drank water from our hands out the faucet  \n\nThe worst and most offensive part of this stay was the morning. I scheduled an Uber to pick us up early for our flight. The bellhop asked me if he could get me a taxi, and I politely declined and explained I already ordered a car. Upon his realization we used Uber, he went and got a taxi driver and collectively they scolded us in the lobby about how I am a terrible New Orleanian for using Uber and I should be ashamed of myself for not supporting local taxi drivers. Humiliating. \n\nWe left Le Pav thirsty and insulted for the start to our honeymoon. I vow to never stay here again, and to warn anyone from spending their money at this establishment.

Hard to fck up a quesadilla, right? I would have preferred breaded buffalo chicken a-la the long-gone Hooters quesadillas but again, I didn't expect much. And I was surprised either. Very little chicken in the quesadilla, mostly tortilla and cheese, a small cup of sour cream and tomatoes in a watery \"hot sauce\".  Followed by side of bland, overcooked tots which weren't blowing my diet over. I left hungry and wishing I'd just eaten the parking charge and gone somewhere else.

At this point I would not be surprised if I contracted hepatitis from this place due to improper cleaning of tools. Calls were frequently not returned even during emergencies. Fillings fell out within two days and was unable to reach any dentists when I finally went in they said they did not do the filling? Unbelievable. Root canal and crown costing 5000 did not last one month and ended up needing to be extracted. I had to pay full price for the extraction. I was billed multiple times during the year for their discount program. Finally I had to say good riddance to Johnson Family Dental. In reviewing my treatment plan from JFD and my new dentist. Johnson Family Dental had recommended a root canal and crown for a molar that did not even have a cavity! I pray to Jesus that anyone considering this dental practice take your time, money and good health to a real dentist.

My restaurant experience was like a series of unfortunate events. We were the only patrons of the restaurant for lunch around 11 am, our party consisted of 7 people. This review will skip over the facilities, but I shall mention that it was unclean and run-down. \n\nFirst unfortunate event was my friend received a cup with pink lipstick stain on it. Second the server was not a good server at all, she didn't know what dishes were what. At one point she was using a spoon to mix up her pho dish to see what was in it. She order pho bo vien and she was looking for the meatballs in it (there weren't any...). \n\nNow we should get to the dishes. We ordered 2 spring rolls and banh xeo for appetizers (these came way after the main entrees). One of my other friends ordered bun bo hue but she received something I do not know (it had pho broth, bun bo hue noodles and none of the right meat). My dish was decent can't complain too much on this. I order com soun. \n\nOn a positive note this will be a unforgettable experience between my friends and I will never forget and be talked about for the next couple months. So I would like to thank you Saigon Maxim","categories":["Chinese","Event Planning & Services","Vietnamese","Restaurants","Venues & Event Spaces"]}

{"stars":1,"text":"This is my first yelp review. I was so disappointed with the service that I decided to make sure others did not have the experience I had. I wanted to like Checkmaid Cleaning like others who have had positive experiences. First of all, the cleaners arrived later than I was told they would arrive. They did not even speak to me about their plan to clean the house just walked around doing things not ensuring my comfort with their presence in my house or asking for my recommendations about precious items that might be breakable or help with anything that needed to be moved. Secondly, the cleaners were cleaning with used rags that were dirty and covered in other people's hair and lint. Third, they did not clean but rather wiped things done as their own personal version of cleaning. Fourth, after the appointed time that they decided that the job should be complete, they decided to cut every corner possible. This translated to rooms that were left basically untouched. For example, there are baseboards were left unclean, the light switches were left dirty, there were cobwebs left, hair on the sink in the bathroom, dirty windowsills, and un cleaned appliances to name a few. Furthermore, the floors were never mopped. \n\nWhen I called customer service, the woman did not apologize or respond to my concern. Instead she responded that her supervisor would call me and evaluate the situation, which he did not. Also, she refused to enter and honor my promotion code and instead was only concerned about processing the method of payment.\nI would recommend that you do not use Checkmaid's service for your next cleaning service unless you want to be out of hundreds of dollars and still have to clean your own house as well as having to spend your time following up with customer service. \nI am completely disgusted!","categories":["Home Cleaning","Home Services"]}

The margherita was fine - this is a difficult pizza to make BAD, but the sauce and tomatoes definitely did not blow my mind. The alla carbonara was actually really disappointing. The egg was overdone and therefore not breakable over the rest of the pizza.

Here is my advice: if you have to get braces....GO SOMEWHERE ELSE...if you don't you will be stuck with them and I promise you, you will regret it. If you have any issues...they will not help and will just treat you like crap.  If you decide to get them there anyway GET EVERYTHING IN WRITING!!!!!! I'm serious. Do NOT go off of a verbal. I did and I got completely screwed. I called them to tell them I was leaving my job to work from home and wanted to get my daughter braces before I left with my current insurance, because, of course, my insurance would be changing.  Their representative told me that if I paid somewhere around $3k that I would be PAID IN FULL. Please read those words. What does Paid in Full mean to you?  Well, apparently, there...it means something else, because now they have completely changed tunes on that deal and said I owe the remaining balance of $1500 bcuz my insurance changed!!!!!!!????  I'm sorry...what?!  Um....of course it changed!!  That's what I said when I called!  They sure didn't say that when I handed over $3000...basically all the money I had!!!  And treated me like some kind of poor welfare Mom afterwards like well if you pay your balance...you mean the balance I shouldn't have?! That balance? ...like I just gave you over $3000 cash. You said I would be and I QUOTE \"PAID IN FULL and the only money I would ever have to pay again for her braces was if she broke more than 3 brackets.\" Just straight liars!!!!!!  And then saying they submitted my claim and I would call my insurance company and they hadn't submitted anything. Just liars!! Then they withheld care to my child! Told me not to bring her in until this issue is resolved. The issue THEY created!! Let's punish a child for your mistake. A mistake that could be corrected by them just doing their job! I drove down from work super frustrated bcuz they hung up on my insurance company who was calling to just resolve the freaking issue AND she wouldn't take their call when they called back! I asked her to just pick up the phone and make a 2 minute call and she refused!!!!  She refused bcuz she knew she hadn't submitted the paperwork like she was saying she did. I'm like \"you don't have two minutes to take care of this issue that has been going on for over a year?\"  She said \"I'm not refusing\"...but then she wouldn't call.  So, for the record...I'm pretty sure that's refusing??? She said she submitted the claim and handed me a bunch of paperwork and I went through the paperwork later and all it proved was that she HAD NOT submit the freaking claim! All she did was printed out some old claim? There is so much other crap I could write but I am just so happy to be done with them as my insurance just finally said I can go somewhere else bcuz they suck so bad.  I just felt like I had to warn others. I wish someone had warned me. Just do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.","categories":["General Dentistry","Cosmetic Dentists","Dentists","Health & Medical","Orthodontists"]}

We ordered our Pizzas and food for delivery and were told 45 mins to an hour ok they were busy no big deal. after waiting an hour and 10 mins. I called to see how much longer and was told they had me down for pick up!?? what the heck! So I asked how long It was going to be now and they told me about another half hour. I asked if I could get a discount because it was their mistake and they said no. So after ! hour and 50 mins I finally get my food COLD and it was looking very chintzy! I called and asked to speak to a manager and was told he wasn't available. I proceeded to tell them this was the last time I would order from them and was very disappointed in their service! Today (6 months later) we decided to give them a second chance. Well this time I ordered for pick up because their delivery was \"at least an hour\" when I got there they took 10 mins to ask me if I had a pick up and then got rude when they found out I forgot my coupon. Unfortunately I didn't look at the pizzas before I left but when I got them home 1 of the pizzas had the wrong toppings on it. I checked the receipt and it was correct so their mistake again! I called and they said they would fix the mistake but if I wanted it delivered it would be another hour and a half! Never again even the 2nd pizza we got was cold. Tired of trying with them. Must find a new pizza place to go to in this town!!

Been to the Caf\u00e9 and Martini Bar, food very good but smaller portions, somewhat pricey but absolutely the most beautiful d\u00e9cor.  \n\nWe were a party of four and decided to eat outside in the Courtyard since it was such a beautiful evening and it is October so cold weather is around the corner.  So disappointed with the menu choices, truly wanted to get something from the Tavern and bring outside.  (I actually asked and said that it was not allowed.)   \n\nIt is basically an overpriced burger, hot dog or drab salad.   My husband's burger came with a bag of chips, no tomato, no pickle, could not even order fries.  My salad was suppose to be a garden salad and it was a very boring spring mix with some tasteless chicken and dressing.  There are a few other items offered but the most limited menu that I have ever seen.  It is hard to believe that with two excellent restaurants on site you can't get something decent to eat in the Courtyard.  It is a shame because the d\u00e9cor again is beautiful, great ambience.  \n\nHopefully, by next Spring they can find a way to expand their menu and offer more of a selection and hopefully something better tasting.

He just kept trying to get me to buy a new phone..not even 2 months ago and since I paid for the phone in full instead of paying it out he couldn't do anything for me. I walked out and went to a phone repair place.  They said that Sprint locks up the phones so they would have a hard time getting into it and that sprint make's sure they have to be the ones that do anything with the phone...well they wouldn't do anything so what I'm I supposed to do?? I am going to stop my Sprint service and go with someone else..I may as well if I can't get any help with this phone.  I'm on hold with Sprint customer service so maybe they will do something...they get you every way if you purchase the phone outright and don't get the insurance.

{"stars":1,"text":"By far the worst dining experience that I have ever experienced. I would not encourage my worst enemy to visit this establishment and here's why: \n\nTo begin, the waiting staff had bad attitudes and did not want to serve our party. They were very short, rude and unpleasant. It appeared our server had a preconceived notion regarding the party that I was with, whom by the way was comprised of all persons of color. However, we continued our dining experience. Later, one member from our group overheard a conversation between two servers negatively talking about our group. Mind you, this group is comprised of doctors, lawyers, nurses, educators, entrepreneurs, and business professionals. Not that it matters but that is what happens when you believe black and brown people cannot spend money in your establishment. What Mesh reminds us that the Confederate South is not only still alive, but very much present on Mass Ave. \n\nWe have heard a lot of negative things about the experiences of persons of color on Mass Avenue but we believed those to be in the past. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The Assistant Manager refused to allow more than 25 people into the restaurant, requiring that we needed to have a reservation! Now, last time I checked, Mesh was not by reservation only. It does not even say anything about it on the website. The manager informed us that they don't cater to groups more than 12 people when in fact, you can use Open Table to reserve a party of 20 people. Yes, we had a party of no more than 30 people, but were told that we could not have more than 25. \n\nThere were five guests who were refused service and were not allowed to enter into the establishment. Treated like criminals when bringing business to this place. Later, we find that we were characterized as \"people who don't tip\" and \"people who wanted free drinks.\" Are you kidding me?! \n\nThe manager then decides to tell his wait staff to \"Call the 'Po Po' on them.\" The bottom line here, we were a group who decided to have brunch at Mesh. Not believing that it would be such a difficult task to eat and commune in the same dining space. Furthermore, there were 5 booths and 3 tables that surrounded us. Management told us, they were reserved. We were there from 11:15 AM - 12:45 PM (not one table was used during this experience).\n\nFinally, this place is not a good place if you're in town visiting. Their treatment of patrons is despicable. Never, ever, have I been told to leave from an establishment and had the police called on my party. Unbelievably nasty experience and the Assistant Manager could have chose to handle this matter in a different way. \n\nI can only imagine what he told the General Manager about our party. Fortunately, everyone has an experience and can share with others. \n\nBeautiful place but the people are not nice nor welcoming.","categories":["Desserts","Seafood","Steakhouses","Food","Bars","American (New)","Breakfast & Brunch","Restaurants","Nightlife"]}

This was a close option although I had heard from several friends not to go there due to the \"range Nazis\" I decided to go and see for myself. \n\nThis is an extremely safe range. $8 to shoot for 2 hours and you can rent your protection and eye\/ear protection and all kinds of other various shooting accoutrements like sand bags should you need them this is a plus you are checked in and off the range by the safety officers making sure that your weapon is unloaded and properly cased etc. all this is good.\n\nThe RSOs ran the range properly, however, I take major issue with how I was treated. It may be my first personally-owned pistol but I'm not a newbie to shooting, nor am I a newbie to shooting pistols and just because I'm female does not mean I'm ignorant. The guys HOVERED. My weapon kept jamming and misfiring and yes it was frustrating but they stepped up immediately, 2-3 of them took my gun from me and did all sorts of things with it without permission.\n\nCourtesy Rule #1 do nor assume I want your help,ask. For the record, I did not. I really just wanted to be left alone.\n\nCourtesy Rule #2 do not hover, there is a thing called personal space and within 1 foot you are violating that. These guys were literally a foot away from me at all times it was nerve-racking\n\nCourtesy Rule #3 DO NOT TOUCH MY WEAPON OR EQUIPMENT WITHOUT MY PERMISSION!  I can't believe I'm even having to type this. This is my weapon I don't know you I don't want your hands on it without my giving you permission you do not touch other people's things without asking. One of the RSOs asked if I was done shooting as I was doing something on my phone and I said yes. He says \"well here let's just do this\" and he packed up everything into my case and shut it as I stared at him dumbfoundedly and says \"there once you go get your target you can just leave.\"\n\nI could not believe he would have the audacity to not only one be rude like that to pack up my weapon without my permission\n\nI will not be returning.

{"stars":3,"text":"Cheese-ology is an interesting proposition: an eatery that offers some interesting twists on a comfort food staple.  If I were rating on quality alone, I would give this place 4 stars.  The dishes are all very good, and a few of them are excellent.  The four cheese and bacon bacon are true standouts, though they do offer a most excellent standard mac and cheese for those who are less adventuresome.\n\nSo why the 3-star rating?  One reason: the price.  Frankly, for what they are charging for even a simple dish, it's hard to find much value.  Small orders are perhaps a bit too small, and the large dishes are just right for the average appetite.  However, $13-15 is too much to pay for what amounts to just a few dollars of ingredients, especially when those prices are higher than even super premium mac and cheese offered at some of the spendier places in town.  Perhaps the premium wouldn't be so hard to swallow if the dishes weren't so easy to replicate at home in mere minutes and for a fraction of the cost.\n\nI'm frankly not sure why they saw fit to charge so much, but if their overhead is too high, they could jettison the liquor license without negating their inherent appeal.\n\nIf they were to drop the price of the large orders to the $7-9 range, they might earn my repeat business.  As it stands now, I simply can't justify going large on rather pedestrian mac and cheese.","categories":["Restaurants","American (Traditional)"]}

We literally exited the airport, jumped into a rental car, and came here.\n\nThe decor is eclectic, colorful and fun, and the stuff on the wall is mostly made by \"Dr. Bob\". There are a few things Elizabeth's would like you to know: Be nice or leave, be nice of leave, alligators, and sandwich.\n\nStarted off with drinks, naturally, because it's New Orleans, and also because it's brunch, and also because it's me. I had the bloody mary, which was served with pickled green beans and various other vegetables. It was pretty good, maybe a tiny bit heavy on the spices (too much Tabasco?). I wouldn't get the mimosa - it seemed weirdly small, like a little shot of mimosa or something.\n\nFor my meal, I opted for the Red Neck Eggs (Fried green Tomatoes with Poached Eggs and Hollandaise) with grits on the side. I insisted that we order a side of Praline Bacon, too. The bacon was pretty delicious - super sugary, nutty bacon. If you like the sweet\/savory combo, you'll probably love these. The Red Neck Eggs was an interesting spin on an eggs benny. The fried green tomatoes were definitely the best, most flavorful part of the dish. The rest of it was pretty mediocre: not bad, but not really noteworthy, and one of the two eggs was overcooked. I'm not really used to ordering grits - most of the ones I've had have been at fancy restaurants where they were prepared super buttery and flavorful. These grits were fine, nothing special.\n\nI liked that we got to see a bit of what is apparently called the Bywater neighborhood.

The rooms were clean and the staff was friendly. The reason I gave it three stars is because the pool looked awful. It did not look clear at all and there was another couple that stayed also and they said the same thing. It looked brown and kind of dingey.

I'd recommend skipping the bread they serve with the salad, as it's terrible.  Also, they put on way too much dressing, so be sure to get the dressing on the side.  It's a pain having to put it on yourself, since you can't really distribute it evenly, but it beats eating a salad that is drenched in what seems to be about a third of a cup of dressing.  (It would be much better if they let you specify the amount of dressing you want them to use, and it seems like it would be easy enough to add this to the card you fill out to order a custom salad.)","categories":["Salad","Sandwiches","Restaurants","Vegetarian"]}

{"stars":3,"text":"We strolled in in a warm rainy night, the restaurant was playing exotic music and half full. We were seated by a man who seems to be the owner, who was really kind and taciturn. \n\nThe owner seems to be trying really hard to bring back the Turkish experience: the decor is exotic, big pots hanging on the wall, nicely spaced out tables and beautifully arranged curtains---except in the middle of all these there is a book shelf clustered with plastic bottles, gums, book binders, prescription meds, surrounded by boxes and wires. That's someone's office\/restroom\/bedroom, it does not belong there.\n\nWe were served two delicious lemony and spicy soups right away, and the served by a short-tempered and passive waitress. The hummus we ordered was delicious but criminally small. The Kabob plate was nearly 18 dollars with only two kabobs sitting on top of a mountain of rice which the cook used an excessive amount of butter to mask his low confidence. The kabobs themselves are amazing, just overpriced.\n\nThis is a restaurant with great potential, but overpriced with bad service. A small polish on a few areas and this place will shine--start with a getting a new server, getting rid of that book shelf and reconsidering the pricing.","categories":["Middle Eastern","Mediterranean","Turkish","American (New)","Restaurants"]}

{"stars":3,"text":"So, Ruby Teusday can be either a hit or a miss, depending on the server you get. Some of the servers are a bit under-experienced and don't really know what to do. My first excursion into this joint, the manager had to compensate me for a free dessert. They do try, but sometimes its best to go to another place instead. \nThis time was no exception. I happened to take my mother out for the 4th of July holiday weekend and there was hardly anyone around. You'd think we would get good service, am I right? Hardly. I ordered a burger, a side of mac & cheese and a loaded baked potatoe. My mom ordered ribs and her normal sides. She was openly offered her the salad bar as a side. But, when I asked for the salad bar in addition to my food, the server grimaced and started to say: \"Well, we can't order the salad bar with any of the burger options.\" She noticed the apparent frown on my face and she quickly did an about face and advised that the salad bar would be an additional cost. \nI did not like that as the worst customer verbiage in my book is the word \"can't\", such as \"we can't do that\", etc. Really, management should teach their servers on the correct verbiage to tell their customers. Permanently tattoo it on their hands, sticky note something to their forheads, put them as button flairs ala office space. Whatever, do something, because the first 5 minutes completely soured that experience. Also, there wasn't enough staff to even provide enough drink refills as I sat there for 20 minutes with an empty glass of Coke Zero. \nAs far as the food experience? Excellent to mediocre. I love their mac & cheese recipe, and thank God, I got the loaded baked potatoe, simply because they gave me a skimpy portion of mac & cheese. \nGreat to mediocre food, but terrible service. So, please, please Mrs. Ruby, think about getting better help!","categories":["Burgers","American (Traditional)","Restaurants","Fast Food"]}

{"stars":3,"text":"I should have done the buffet.\n\nI went during weekday lunch.  There's a lunchtime buffet that I think is around $8... I should have done that, but instead ordered an entree: combo plate with beef and jerk chicken.\n\nAmbience - it's dark, cozy and nicely themed (with Jamaican colors and vibe).  Between 12noon - 1p there were a total of 5 tables occupied (three were solo, like I was this time, and two tables had a couple of folks at them).  This made the place barely 1\/4 occupied (roughly 16 tables with half being 4-tops and half being 2-tops).  This location (5305 Speedway) is much better than their old one and parking is free and plentiful.\n\nThe buffet had 3 warming trays and featured (from the sign) jerk chicken; talapia and plantains I think.  There were two huge guys sitting at separate tables near the buffet and they had easily consumed 3-4 platefuls of food... I don't know how CeeDee can break even on them and clearly I should have gone the route of the endless jerk chicken buffet too.\n\nMy entree this time (as in previous times) was a mixed result.  The jerk chicken, (chopped pieces, bone-in, including sections of thigh and drumsticks) was VERY good.  The chicken was just-charred and had that signature tangy sauce on it.  The curry beef was terrible, however.  The curry flavor was good, albeit subtle and dry, not soupy enough to mingle with the rice.  But the beef portion was full of fat and\/or gristle.  At $14 for the entree (with rice, steamed cabbage and plantains) it was overpriced.  The chicken portion consisted of a small leg (like the winglet kind) and maybe 1\/4 of a thigh (two spoon-sized chunks).  the beef serving amounted to maybe 4 oz or half a cup of cubed meat mixed with a few chopped carrots.  The side cabbage was delicious and so were the plantains!... not crisp as some have complained, but very substantial, sweet and still fried on a grill.\n\nIn sum, there were some definite hits (the jerk chicken; plantains) and misses (besides the beef, I've also had the goat and the oxtail before:  the goat was even more chock full of gristle and the oxtail simply was too much work for me to eat (with too little meat\/protein overall).  The joint gets an \"ok\" from me, but I think I will try their buffet, as that has to be the caveman's bargain here!","categories":["Caribbean","Restaurants"]}
{"stars":3,"text":"I like the store, and people are friendly. Prices are similar to other running stores. \n\n2 stars off because (a) even though pricing is in line with other running stores, I still think prices charged for running accessories are out of control. And (b) there's road construction out front and the entrance to the parking lot is blocked. Obviously resolvable, but maybe you should put up signs directing people where to go to park considering you're doing a race packet pickup for a big halloween race. \n\nFinally, and I won't remove another star for this, but yelp has a free gift with check in. Doesn't say what it is. I showed the employee the offer and they had no idea what it is. And they asked another employee who had no idea what it is. \n\nThis is not the first business with whom I have experienced this. It's like the owners make a deal with yelp and don't bother to tell any of their employees. Kind of BS. \n\nI realize it wasn't going to be a free pair of running shoes. I'm not stupid. But it's the principle. It's like advertising a sale with none of the clerks knowing about it, so your customers don't get the discounts. Just seems like you're trying to lure people in. \n\nI'm sure it was a honest mistake. Owners of Fit to Run probably have more important things to worry about. And I'm positive many would disagree with even mentioning it over not getting my free shoelaces or 5% off or free rehydrate drink or whatever it is.

And although the service was good and the restaurant was clean and spacious, the food was a big let down.....bland.\nUnderstand that I like flavor, not especially spicy hot flavor, but I like when a food has more than a simple \"one note\" taste.  \n\nWhen we arrived, our waitress brought us salsa and chips.  (She didn't ask if we wanted them and there was NO charge for them, so maybe they have changed their business plan and are giving them free like the competition does.)  The salsa was thin and quite mild.  Not bad, but I was surprised when my wife who prefers less spicy food made the comment that there wasn't much flavor.\n\nWe then ordered the Street Corn which was wonderful!  It is on the pricey side ($7.50 for 3 half ears of corn) but it was the best thing we tried.\n\nMy wife ordered a Taco Salad and apparently, she must not have read the description very carefully.  Instead of a crunchy bowl filled with lots of flavors, she got a plate with the ingredients spread out with a few crunchy tortilla strips on top.  If you like the crunch, then this is disappointing.  And the flavor was lacking.\n\nI went with the Carne Asada which I had read was excellent, but this was the least favorite.  The steak is sliced into three thin slices, cooked well done, but without any char.  Very little seasoning.  I will concede they do give a lot of meat (each slice is larger than the corn tortilla), but it comes with lettuce, about a quarter cup of pico de gallo, and two roasted green onions.  Nothing else.  No sauteed peppers or guacamole, no sour cream or cheese, and very little seasoning. I can't say that the food was bad (I did eat them) but I can't figure out how this was supposed to be a great meal...did they forget to bring something?\n\nFor anyone still reading this, they do offer first time Yelpers a 10% discount.  That is a nice perk which was appreciated.\n\nOverall, with all the Mexican places that I've really enjoyed dining at, I can't say I will stopping in here again.\n\nReview #2097","categories":["Restaurants","Mexican"]}

We called ahead and they do not take reservations, though the wait at that time was only 10 minutes. Perfect. We Ubered over and were dropped off on the corner. We accidentally walked into the exit door, which yes, is clearly marked. We were instantly chastised by the person at the register. We get to the correct door to be \"greeted\" by another person who hated their job, letting us know where to stand in line.

Our party gets to the register and the person says \"Shit\" when she ran my friend's credit card and disappears. With her credit card, no less. She finally comes back and pretty much stares us down while she waits for someone to fix whatever is going on without ever letting us knowing what is going on. While we are waiting the people behind the counter are cursing at one another and being extremely disrespectful towards one another. Speaking about each other's children?

The area to dress your drink with sweetener or cream and a lid for your drink is perhaps the most frustrating in the whole experience.\nThis is where the traffic begins and customers begin to back each other up.  there just is not enough room for you to get your drink a lid and sweetener or cream because this pick up end of the bar only can take a single person at a time.

{"stars":3,"text":"I came upon Bitar's when I received a groupon from a friend for $20. Two friends and I decided to go one day that we all had off work, a 92 degree summer day. When we arrived we were turned off right away by the stifling heat, it was hotter inside than outside. Nothing is more disappointing than expecting the relief of AC only to be enveloped by an inescapable wall of heat. Anyway, we made our way to the counter and were greeted by a less than happy worker. (I guess I wouldn't be very pleasant working in those conditions either). When my friend ordered the chicken kabob she simply replied, \"Chicken?! Really?!\" rather sarcastically. If you don't want to cook chicken, don't have it on the menu...or get an AC unit. With that said I won't complain too much as we only paid $3\/ea. for our meals.\n\nThe other side of the restaurant had a small store with various middle eastern products and treats. We were much too hot to stick around and get anything, but everything looked good and reasonably priced.\n\nWe waited outside where there were a couple small tables and chairs until the food was ready. We all ordered to-go. When we arrived at our destination we dug in. The food was surprisingly better than I expected, I ordered the gyro platter (Lamb\/beef over lettuce and tomato). It came with hummus and tabouli salad which both tasted very fresh, all together with the pita, the flavors all worked together very nicely. The portion was also large and enough to leave us all full and happy. \n\nWith an AC unit and more friendly staff, this place would easily have earned itself a 4, but until then I probably won't be going back unless I get another good deal. Keep in mind I live across the city from this place.","categories":["Restaurants","Middle Eastern","Falafel","Bakeries","Food","Greek","Mediterranean"]}

I love the concept though nothing will ever compare to the good old days of Hollywood Bar and Filmworks downtown...man I loved that place, but I digress!  Here are my tips about SMG in no particular order.\n\nTIP - go for a matinee and you'll get way better service!  As you've seen from other reviewers, the service is not awesome but I've realized a trend.  Fewer folks in the audience = waaaay better service.  It's not rocket science but it's true.\n\nTIP - don't wait around to order once you arrive in the theatre.  Know what you want when you go in and press your fancy little button as soon as your little keister hits that seat.  Otherwise, you'll be in for a long wait.  That button that says press for IMMEDIATE service is a big fatty lie.  \n\nTIP - Groupon almost always has a deal, so in order to make this experience worth your while, check it out before you shell out the full price for tickets.  \n\nTIP\/RAMBLING - The food selection is so-so.   The first few times I went there I never found anything I really liked but my fiance loves the coconut chicken fingers so that is his go to.  Fast forward a few months to the time I went and ordered the Black and Blue Burger...this thing was seriously amazing!  The blue cheese was to die for and I was so estatic that I'd found this gem of a burger.  For the next few months I'd dreamt about said burger so I was actually excited to get it the next time I went.  Imagine my dismay and sadness when they'd taken it off the menu!  I was honestly heartbroken, haha!  They said the blue cheese was too expensive to keep on the menu.  Boo.  I'd pay 3 dollars extra for that blue cheese right about now.  Again, I digress.  \n\nThe bottom line is that it is fun to go to this place to see movies if you have a Groupon and don't have your expectations for fantastic service set too high.","categories":["Cinema","Arts & Entertainment","Bars","American (Traditional)","Restaurants","Nightlife"]}

She has always been kind and when I had a problem with my nose I called her and she gave me a ton of information and help. \n- The selection of jewelry is pretty good, and if you're looking for something they'll most likely have it. \n- Their buy one get one free sales happen quite frequently and are honestly a really good deal. One of the reasons why I keep going back here. \n\n\nThe Cons:\n- Cash only. I never have cash on me and I always have to use the ATM in the shop, which, of course, has ATM fees. So annoying. It's 2015! So many people pay debit\/credit and it seems kind of ridiculous to not have a debit machine in store. \n- The front staff are rude. Like, every time I have gone they've been rude.

As I'm getting older, I'm finding that arugula tickles my tastebuds now (in my younger years, I found it to be too bitter).  I was shocked though to find that they were out of the Parmesan.... Really for an Italian restaurant?\n\nOverall, great place, a little pricey, good location, nice atmosphere and whaddya know....

{"stars":3,"text":"This is my first review of a non food place, so bear with me. It's not going to be a long review.\n\nFirst off, I was not sure what kind of style I wanted. I was handed a book to pick a style. I picked one similar to what I wanted. The lady told me, it won't look exactly like that, since I have curly hair. I picked one that had fairly spikey hair.\n\nAfter she cut it, I got a shampoo. They put a scented towel over my face while massaging my hair slowoly. This was all fine.\n\nWe went back to the chair, she put some cream in my hair, and that was it. My hair came put looking like any other place I've been to to get my hair done. It wasn't spiked, like I wanted it, it was just fluffed up a bit.\n\nI was even more surprised to find that the hair cut costed me $30 bucks!\n\nWhat I feel is, what was the point in handing me a book to choose a style, when they just end up doing what any other place does, and for at least 10 bucks less. I could have went to fantastic sames, and got the cut for roughly $10.\n\nAll in all, while they have a weird kwerk here or there, it is definantly not worth the high price.","categories":["Hair Salons","Men's Hair Salons","Beauty & Spas","Barbers"]}

{"stars":3,"text":"Never let it be said that you can't find something to eat in the late morning\/early afternoon on Christmas Eve in downtown Indianapolis.  However, it's difficult if you're looking for something other than fast food.  Thankfully, the wife and I were staying at the JW Marriott and rather than venture out into the cold, wet weather, we opted for High Velocity, the sports bar on the property.  High Velocity is a tasteful, modern, cavernous, and somewhat generic space with plenty of HD flat panels for watching sports.  Given it was a Wednesday afternoon; they might as well have left them turned off.\n\nHigh Velocity's menu was fairly standard bar fare.  Keeping it Hoosier real, I ordered the Pork Tenderloin sandwich ($13), which was topped with lettuce, tomato, and raw onion, jalape\u00f1o coleslaw, and poblano mayo on a brioche bun.  It also came with fries, and a pickle.  If Philadelphia has its cheese steak, Indy has its fried pork tenderloin.  The sandwich was definitely Hoosier-sized as the pork tenderloin was pounded into a thin, almost Frisbee-sized disc, then breaded, deep-fried, and placed between the brioche bun with the meat extending far beyond its reaches.  For what it was, the sandwich was perfectly fried, appropriately seasoned, and nicely crispy without the pork becoming rubbery or jerky-like.  It was a tasty, generous sandwich and with the fries, left me quite satisfied.  That said, I'm sure the same sandwich could be had for much less elsewhere in the local area, but we were paying for the convenience of it being in the hotel sports bar.  If there was any downside to our meal, service was a bit inattentive, but I attribute that more to the fact that the staff was eager to get off shift early since it was Christmas Eve.\n\nHigh Velocity is what it is.  It's not a destination bar or restaurant.  As sports bars go, there are plenty of others in the downtown area that offer much more personality and excitement.  As restaurants go, there are others that offer more bang for the buck.  However, when your choices are limited or your lacking motivation to leave the hotel, High Velocity does the trick.","categories":["Nightlife","Bars","Venues & Event Spaces","Event Planning & Services","Restaurants","Sports Bars","American (New)"]}

{"stars":3,"text":"I really don't understand all the 5 star reviews for this restaurant. Believe me, me and my wife really wanted to like this place but we left disappointed.\n\nInside has a nice warm charm to it. Although a little bit small inside and the lighting was too bright. Just plain white florescent, lay-in light fixtures are used  The service was decent. Although, the soup I ordered never came out. I guess our waitress forgot. I didn't say anything because we already had a bunch of food on our table.\n\nBut here is where Babushka's really falls flat. All of the food tasted really plain and not seasoned at all. Just really dull and ehhh. I mean nothing really tasted bad but none of the items had any good taste. And the food came out really fast. Between that and the way it tasted, I think most of the food items are not homemade. \nWe started off with the Pickles Mix. It was way too funny but sad, the pickles (gherkins - btw), sauerkraut, and olives came straight from the jar or bag that they bought from Publix or Winn-Dixie. Sauerkraut was tasteless and cold. They didn't even drain the juice from the bag \/ can it came from.\nI then got the Kotlety and my wife got the Beef Stroganoff. The beef used in the Kotlety was your basic ground chuck just rolled up into 3 small meatballs but with no seasoning. It was very bland. The 3 meatballs sit on a store-bought pita wrap. One of my sides that I got was buckwheat. It too was very bland and dry. It was basically plain quinoa. The Beef Stroganoff that my wife got was ok. Again it just needed something added to the sauce and\/or meat to make it taste good. Sauce could have been a little more creamier.\nAs extra we did try Babushka's Beef Pelmeni's (with sour cream). These were good. Nothing to write home about but not bad either. Only problem I had with this is they give you a teaspoon of sour cream.\n\nBabushka's is not expensive but also not cheap.

I get it,  we American's are fat, and like lots of food, but this is different. ShakeShack is expensive, and needs to give a little more. The milkshakes were great, probably one of the best in the city. Milkshake is small too, but that's not a bad thing. Those should be small since a milkshake is not a drink, it's a dessert, so the smaller portion is accurate.

One person's burger had half their cheese on their wrapper. \n\nBuns are dry, and burgers were not all cooked to the same level.

{"stars":3,"text":"Though I have a lot of nostalgia attached to Mona Lisa, as my last review states, I can't keep my review at five stars when I recently had a pretty sub par experience. \n\nAs always, I ordered a pizza since I felt like splurging and eating cheese, which is rare these days. After eating half of a small one, I gave in and didn't even take the rest home for leftovers. From the bland sauce the the thick, doughy crust, it was mediocre all over. And I was pretty damn hungry. I can't in good faith recommend the pizza after that experience. The other issue was my friend who's on a limited diet made the grave, grave error of asking for a substitution (broccoli, rather than cheese) on her salad... which, judging by the amused look our server gave us, is a big no-no. That's fine, I get it, chefs hate substitutions. She then asked if she could just pay for broccoli to be added to her salad. Again, no. You can't even order a side of broccoli. This kind of thing I don't get, seeing as you can add broccoli as a pizza topping, so, what gives? Not sure if that was on the server (he said he'd ask the kitchen, but then never gave an answer one way or another, nor did broccoli ever appear). I don't mean to say he gave us poor service, because otherwise he was attentive and pretty cool. \n\nIf this were my first visit here, I don't know if I'd return between the frowning on any kind of altering stuff off the menu and the mediocre pizza.

{"stars":3,"text":"I stopped by here this past Saturday afternoon for lunch with my wife.  While we were in St Louis my wife and I wanted to try their pizza and were pointed to Imos as the place to try authentic St Louis pizza.  We had a tough time finding this Imos as the location wasn't on any of the maps for Westport Plaza.  However after turning a corner we eventually located it and after debating whether or not it was open, we headed inside.  The inside of the place was actually quite nice and consisted of a bar, a large seating area and a couple of flat screen TVs.  Whenever we arrived (inbetween 2 and 3 pm) we were the only people there and continued to be the only customers the entire time that we were there.\n\nFor lunch my wife and I decided to split a large pepperoni pizza.  Whenever it was brought out to our table my first thought was \"that's it?\"  It's not that it was a terribly small pizza but it cost enough that I somehow thought it was going to be larger.  The thin crust of the pizza also helped to give it the appearance that it was less food than it actually was.  It was cut three times vertically and three times horizontally creating many small squarish type pieces.  As with all pizzas this one could be broken down into its three major components: crust, cheese, and sauce.  The crust on this pizza was thin and was cooked to a nice crispiness which I really enjoyed.  It's sauce got lost behind the cheese which I think was the most interesting part.  There was an ample amount of it and it was provel.  I don't know that I have had cheese like it before although it had a pleasing taste to it.  One thing about it that I didn't really notice was it having a clean bite which is supposedly the reason it was created.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I might return to Imos in the future.  It was definitely a different pizza than I am used to getting and while it tasted pretty good, I feel like I could have done better for my money.","categories":["Pizza","Salad","Restaurants","Sandwiches"]}

Typically I call ahead and then walk over at the time they say it will be done. It is usually not done at their estimate time, but I always go in with the expectation it won't be :)\n\nThe pizza is delicious basic pizza! If you sign up for their app, you get notification every Friday for their pie of the week which is 50% off. This is always a specialty pizza so it is a great deal! Keep your eyes peeled too because they always pass out cards around town for free stix! Great incentive for me to order from here!","categories":["Pizza","Nightlife","Food","Restaurants"]}
{"stars":3,"text":"I've been twice now for lunch. First time I had a sandwich with a fried green tomato on top that was really good. I forget what all was in it but, it tasted great. I also tried the wings and they were spot on. Smokey, sweet, peppery, everything I love. They were out of fatty brisket and my coworker was forced to choose the lean. It was SUPER DRY. Nice bark and smoke ring but I could tell by looking at it that it should have been chopped and put in a sandwich. I was really glad I didn't order any. \n\nI asked for more pickles because they have some really good pickles but man you'd think you were asking for the combo to fort knox to get anything more than 5-6 super thin slices. \n\nSauce bottles are hard to keep at your table as they don't have enough to go around at lunch. I'd like to say this BBQ is good enough that you don't want sauce or much sauce, but yes sauce improves the experience here. \n\nMy 2nd visit I got the full order of wagyu brisket fatty. It was really moist and the fat was well rendered. I'll admit I could tell it was another level of beef. The flavor was good too. But no where near good enough to justify the price. I honestly like the plain old Brisket at a competitor better.  \n\nI do LOVE their Tortilla's and ended up wrapping my brisket up in one with the tiny side of pickles they included. \n\nMac and cheese is good, but nothing to write home about. \nMy BBQ beans and my coworkers agreed were very UNDERDONE almost crunchy BBQ beans. \n\nI haven't had the PORK STEAK but It looks great and people do rave. I'll return for this.  \n\nWhats missing for me at Beast: \nAccess to drink lids and straws (near the fountain) \nAccess to sauce at the table \nAccess to Onion, Jalapeno, Pickles, Lemon, etc \nSides need to include okra or greens or something not fried or carbo. \nMore description of the menu. Whats in the potato salad? \nPrice if you want our regular lunch business a deal for about $10 is essential. But we do splurge for places that are worth it from time to time. Unfortunately Beast isn't wowing enough of our work party to justify a $14-$18 lunch.","categories":["Burgers","Barbeque","Restaurants"]}
{"stars":3,"text":"I want to start off this review by saying I have been frequenting Dino's for several years now. Their pizza is fantastic, salads are pretty good, and everything else is either average or slightly above average (except their bruschetta. Don't order that, it's not very good.) I would also like to compliment Jason as well as every staff member for being friendly and professional.\n\nNow, that being said, I would give this place more like 2.5 stars than 3. You must be wondering why, considering the good things I stated above, but the actual owner of this establishment (Luigi) is the rudest, most unprofessional person and I am shocked that he's been able to keep his business afloat for so long. I chalk that up to the pleasant staff and decent food. \n\nThere was an incident the other day. I wanted to place a order for delivery so I called. The conversation went like this.\n\n\"Dino's, hold.\" \nSo I waited. Then he picked up the line again and said, \"Pickup or delivery.\" I said delivery. He asked for my number and proceeded to ask me, \"What do you want?\" I'm sorry, but I work in the food business, and I would never in a million years greet a guest that way, over the phone or not. I understand that may have been busy, but his utter lack of concern\/friendliness is gross and unacceptable. But I was like, whatever. I placed an order for a Stromboli, 6 wings, garlic knots, 2 slices, and chocolate cake. He said okay, didn't tell me the total or ask cash or credit, then said \"Give me 45 minutes\" and hung up. I ended up having to call back to give my credit card details because I could not get a word in to let him know I was paying with a credit card.\n\nFast forward 45 minutes, our food arrives. We're missing our garlic knots. A bit of backstory, my boyfriend worked for Dino's for a very short period of time about a year ago and has remained on good terms with some of his ex coworkers. So we call them up, very politely tell them we didn't receive our garlic knots, and the nice guy on the phone (Joey) told us not to worry about it and he would have garlic knots delivered to us. In the background on the phone, I could hear the owner yelling about how I didn't order garlic knots. Super professional. \n\nAbout 10 minutes later MY phone rings. My boyfriend happened to be near my phone so he answered. The owner, Luigi, was on the line and proceeded to go on a rant about how I was lying, how I had failed to place the correct order, and that we would not be receiving our garlic knots. I was pissed, it had nothing to do with the food at this point. But the fact that he thought it was okay to call my phone to ARGUE with me?! Over garlic knots?! When I'm a paying customer who simply asked that I receive what I ordered?! I didn't even mind paying either, but he still refused to fix the issue. Thank goodness my boyfriend answered the phone, because I would have been less than friendly had I picked up that phone call.\n\nSo this is what I have to say about Dino's. Their pizza is great, definitely check it out. Their staff is friendly. But they seriously need to do something about the owner, because he is the most unpleasant and unprofessional person I have ever had to deal with.","categories":["Pizza","Restaurants"]}

One of the English muffins was topped with lobster claw meat that was, for the most part, still in 'claw shape.' The other English muffin did not have any meat on top (it had all fallen to the side of the muffin). And it was pretty mangled - not discernibly 'claw shaped.' \n\nAnd I wish the lobster had been de-shelled better.

{"stars":3,"text":"While I had purchased my wedding dress elsewhere, I really fell in love with bridesmaid's dresses from here. They were exactly what I was looking for, so I headed to the store with one of my bridesmaids to make sure they were as perfect in person as they were online. I'm a busy person, as are my bridesmaids, so I didn't make an appointment (nor did I feel I needed one bc I already knew what I was looking for--this was going to be the easiest sale of someone's day). When we walked in, it took forever for someone to acknowledge us and then when I stated I didn't have an appointment and knew what I was there to look for, the sales person gave attitude and stated \"you really should have made an appointment.\" Ok--fine, just let me look at the dress I'm about to send 8 people to purchase from you. I found the dress on my own, my bridesmaid tried it on, and that was that--no assistance needed. As we were taking the dress back over to the rack, a salesperson came out of nowhere and essentially demanded we tell her what we were looking for. I told her we found it and we're going to the counter to order, as I had the style pulled up on my phone. She told me I HAD to work with a stylist for it and that I should have my bridesmaid try on more than the 2 dresses (I ended up choosing 2 of the same with different necklines so each girl can choose). I explained my mind was made up, thank you though, and was ready to get my bridal party set up. I finally was able to get this done; however, my friend in DC went to order her dress and they had put the wrong wedding date. I called this location to have it updated and no one cared to fix it or even follow up with me. I will say, when I went to pick up flower girl baskets, the manager assisting me was much better than the previous person. She made my rating 3 star worthy.","categories":["Shopping","Bridal"]}
{"stars":3,"text":"I struggled with a 2-3 star rating but decided on a 3 to be nice even though I was not satisfied with their drinks. \n\nCame in here on a Sunday night, wanted a drink and some good bar food.  I left getting neither.  First the place is clean and modern.  I love their little ice block on the bar that keeps drinks cold, I thought that was pretty cool.  Tons of beers on tap and extensive selection.  I am no beer girl.  So I ordered my mixed drink and it came back kind of nasty - just an imbalance of liquors in the cocktail I ordered.  I still drank it.  My girlfriend and I ordered French onion soup, fried pickles, boneless wings and garlic parm fries.  The French onion soup was barely hot (and that is weird because it usually goes right under the broiler - maybe it waited a while to be picked up who knows).  The soup was mushy, croutons in it were mushy.  It is rare I will meet a French onion soup I do not like and this was the day.  Worst French onion ever.  My girlfriend loves fried pickles I could do without them.  She made me try one.  So I give it some cool points for the fact that I could bite into it and it didn't pull the rest of the pickle out. That is good but the seasoning on the breading is disgusting and too overpowering.  Garlic parm fries were really good but for the price you got such a small portion.  The boneless sweet thai wings were not good.  The boneless wings were kind of hard.  This could be from over frying or maybe they had freezer burn in the freezer.  The thai sauce sucked it was almost un thai like.  Drinks were semi expensive for the quality and service received. I do not think I would go back. But I am sure someone could get a semi good meal here.  Maybe it was an off night.","categories":["Pubs","Nightlife","Cocktail Bars","Beer Bar","Sports Bars","Gastropubs","Restaurants","Sandwiches","Bars"]}

I wish I could get on board with his enthusiasm for DTB, but Shari V and I found the place average.\n\nFor apps, we had the duck wings and squash blossoms.  The duck wings were tasty, but the wing sauce had congealed on the outside.  Who knows?   Maybe this was on purpose, but it had a slimy texture and certainly was not visually appealing.  For taste, the duck wings were decent.  The squash blossoms were stuffed with crawfish.  They were also ok.  I think we were served three and neither me nor Shari V were enthusiastic to eat the third one. \n\nFor my entree, I had the short rib.  According to the menu, it was cooked over 48 hours.  That might have been a few hours too many.  The flavor was great.  Very smokey, which I like.  Unfortunately, the meat was a bit dried out.  For short rib, it was a little thin on marbling but maybe that's by design.  Not sure here, but with little marbling, each bite had to be taken down with a few follow up sips of beverage.  \n\nOur server was nice.  She seemed to know very little about food and surprisingly not much about the menu.  I did have to flag down a water guy once or twice. \n\nAs mentioned, DTB is ok.

{"stars":3,"text":"Stopped by here one day after getting my car washed. This restaurant is located in the same shopping plaza as a carwash, nail shop and a couple other stores\/restaurants. Upon entrance, the restaurant looked very clean and I was greeted by a lady behind the counter. I placed my order for a bbq chicken dinner and bbq ribs dinner. I felt the price for the chicken was too much. It was equivalent to the price of the ribs, which was about $15. The dinner includes two sides. There is a variety of southern cooked sides to include cornbread. I received my order and left, just to get home and see that two of my sides were not inside my bag. I called in and they said I could come back and get the sides. We agreed I'd pick up the sides on the next day. I was very upset but I felt assured my dinners were all together and complete. I felt the lady was distracted by the other customer. I picked up my sides the next day but didn't have anything to eat it with, as I wasn't going to purchase another meal due to the restaurant's error. \nI can say that I enjoy their sweet potatoes and the banana pudding. However, the banana pudding needs more cookies and more sliced bananas. The bananas are so sparse, especially! Please fix that! The ribs and the chicken were okay but the bbq sauce wasn't on the ribs. They serve it on side, which I don't understand. You can make a batch with bbq already on it and have a plain batch all the same. Just a thought.\nThe location is great, plenty of parking, there are restrooms and the restaurant inside is spacious enough for groups. There are TV's hanging from the ceiling for your viewing pleasure along with other d\u00e9cor.\n\nOverall, it's an okay bbq spot (recently opened within the past 1-2 years), so there is time to improve.","categories":["Chicken Shop","Sandwiches","Barbeque","Restaurants"]}
{"stars":3,"text":"I went here once several months back with some friends eating full dinner but I just had sides and didn't think that made me qualified to review the place yet. But the sides I had back then were good. \n\nThen, I had an out-of-town guest for the second weekend in a row and didn't feel like going to any of the usual suspects for dinner again. And since High Hat was in the vicinity of our evening plans (and open on Sunday night, which MATTERS in this town), I looked to see what Yelp was saying about it lately. Seems like some folks were not too impressed. And I want you to know, your opinion matters to me, unimpressed Yelpers, but since I was in charge of feeding a visitor who had never been here before, I figured it was the perfect time to give it a shot. Because she wouldn't know any better! I mean, she didn't want to stand in line at Mahoney's the day before for her first ever po-boy and went to Ignatius instead! And she loved it! You see? Can't miss what you never had. \n\nAnyway, if you've ever passed the space, you know what it looks like because it's all windows and fairly open arrangement. Tile floors, so it can get a bit noisy, but it feels cozier and warmer full than it looks when it's empty. But enough of that. You can't eat the atmosphere, right? \n\nAppetizer:\nBoudin. Stone-ground mustard, pickles that I'm guessing are housemade (definitely not Vlassic), and a few slices off a french roll accompany the large boudin patty. I appreciated that they weren't pawning off deep fried balls of boudin but letting the actual sausage stand on its own merits. It's good stuff though not the spicy kind.\n\nEntrees: \n-Catfish (tender but also a bit thin and soggy, corn meal coating could have had some more flavor going on),\n\n-Smoked and roasted chicken (very impressive - moist, good smoke, crispy skin)\n\n-Meatloaf special (yeah I don't know why, either. But it was OK) \n\nSides: \n-Hushpuppies (good flavor, a little dry, small, and over-fried) \n\n-Mashed potatoes with white gravy (good and lumpy)\n\n-Tomato and okra (stewed and bland) \n\n-Mustard greens (standard to bland) \n\n-French fries (pretty tasty. They could mix more of the salt\/seasonings they use on those into the corn meal coating for the fish and I'd be happy). \n\nAnd satsuma lemonades for everyone, which were fun but in hindsight I shoulda just gone with regular lemonade. Satsuma slices clog up a straw real effectively. I have had their Pimm's cup before and I recall it being pretty good. \n\nAnd the service was on top of our waters and checked in often, despite the place being about 90% full when we entered. So maybe they have those issues ironed out now? \n\nSo there you go. It wasn't the best meal I ever had. But I wouldn't mind going there again. The visitor, by the way, loved the place and couldn't stop thanking us for taking her there (and she was the one who paid the bill, in case you were thinking she was being grateful for the free grub).","categories":["Soul Food","Burgers","Nightlife","Bars","Restaurants","Southern","Seafood"]}

Nice and cozy cabin with a\/c, Gas Bar-B-Q on the front deck Queen size bed in the bedroom, and it was quite comfy  although the sleeper sofa was garbage, very uncomfortable to set on I can't imagine sleeping on it's bed.. Rancho Oso is a bit pricey for what it is,but I found Great friendly service, clean room, nice pool with an hour in the morning and one in the evening with no kids allowed in the pool (Adult time), but some kids still in pool area during that so called adult time.. & hot tub,( don't get me wrong I love kids but adult pool time means just that! Some quiet time would of been nice too). Clean grounds & horses too. The wifi was not good at all. It is a 35-40 minute drive to Santa Barbara but worth the drive in savings and scenery. What ever you do, do not follow Google's GPS  directions! You will never get there. Stay on 154 until you see paradise road turn off, then go right.... Do NOT turn right on Camino Cielo like the GPS says !!!! Especially if your towing a trailer.. If you do you will be sorry and you will never get there... We will go again. Thank you Rancho Oso but please do something with that wifi or at least don't claim to have it, as it is very poor at best.","categories":["Campgrounds","RV Parks","Hotels & Travel","Horseback Riding","Active Life"]}

I was not even aware the place existed, so we decided to check it out. We only ordered a couple of dishes to share before we made a bigger commitment. We started with the pork belly buns. They had good flavor but were not very hot.\n\nMy wife tried the beef shank soup. Served much hotter than the buns, it was a good mix of savory, sour and spicy. But it was definitely not Pho. Again, we were a bit biased because we had our minds set on the Pho. \n\nMy boys and I split the stir-fried noodles with pork. Again, much hotter than the buns, but not great. Very greasy and not too much flavor. \n\nI am glad we tried this place out, but I would have preferred the Pho.","categories":["Restaurants","Taiwanese"]}

Located next to the river valley among the richly rich, its one of those restaurants that used to be a house.

The presentation on the eggs Benedict was superb and the hollandaise sauce was delicious. The bacon was thick...and greasy, so greasy, like sit on the bottom of your stomach for days greasy. And then the food wasn't even that hot. Eggs Benedict should be served hot. Who likes eating cold eggs? They were perfectly soft boiled but cold. The whole thing was 14$ for just the benny. You can add potatoes for 3$ but they give you 5 little sliced potatoes. Yes they serve it with home made ketchup. But 3$ for 5 tiny potato pieces. Give me an orange slice or something. Okay so atmosphere and presentation is a 5 for sure. But food gets a 3.

However, that drink was more expensive than the drink she originally ordered, and we were not made aware of that. \n\nWhen we were finally seated, we ordered right away. I got the Mexico City Street Tacos with steak, which I have ordered and loved before.

{"stars":3,"text":"Ordered takeout from Hello Vietnam as part of NoLibs restaurant week since the deal was one of the standouts - for $25, you got your choice of entree, a soup or salad, a roll, and a passionfruit tea. Not a bad deal! The choice of entrees for the restaurant week deal was a little more limited than the rest of the menu, but still plenty of options to pick from. We opted for the beef vermicelli, which came with a light seasoning (remember the chives mostly) and the vermicelli noodles. It was a decent sized portion, and the beef was decently cooked - perhaps a little tougher than I would prefer, but still good. The vermicelli were a nice, light accompaniment. We went for the lotus roots salad, which featured some peanuts, shallots, carrots, and shrimp - very nice, fresh flavors. For the roll, we went for the avocado summer rolls - pretty standard roll, but had a really nice peanut sauce for dipping. The passionfruit tea was a bubble-ish tea - a little sweet for my liking, but quite refreshing and  tasty. For $25, it was a good deal and fed two of us appropriately. We did order an extra side of spring rolls, but unfortunately, we never received these :( No worries though, we had enough food to keep us full. Overall, the quality was OK - not the best food I've ever had, but it was good quality and tasty.

It was kind of crazy that their generic brands look EXACTLY like the national brands. I had to do a double take to make sure I was seeing correctly.

A bit of memory jogging and walking around, and we found the destination.\n\nBut is looks like our memory became a bit rosier than the reality over the years: the service was stand-offish: the \"miss\" who was helping us was inattentive, dismissive, and kept chatting with her coworker instead of focusing on the customer. The cannoli, which we took a mascarpone and chocolate mousse to try, was disappointing: mascarpone tasted like whipped cream.  What a let-down.

It shares its storefront with a Starbucks.\n\nGotta say, I was less than impressed. The fact that it's a half-Starbucks and inside a hotel, I think, gives them license to just not really care all that much. I dunno.\n\nThere weren't many flavors, though they had grape, which is unique. If that's your thing. And there weren't many toppings, either. The place was just generally half-assed, I guess being in so small a space or something. Like, \"Hey, frozen yogurt is popular with the kids these days, let's haphazardly shove one in the Hilton! We'll make a mint!\" Shhhyeah. \n\nOh, and the worker was not nearly as cheerful as at the other places, and she didn't seem to care much when I told her the whipped cream was completely out (come on, you work at a frozen yogurt store, and the place was dead, at least pay attention to stuff like that?).\n\nThe cheesecake bits were tasty.\n\nThe frozen yogurt was runny.

The food was also really good, which is not always the case at weddings. I'm not sure you can find a more beautiful venue in the central Indiana region. \n\nWhile the venue and grounds are top notch, the staff at the Black Iris were much less accommodating.  Being a \"covid bride,\" we had to go through many changes, including changing our date.  The Black Iris was pretty inflexible on changing our date, providing us with a handful of dates in 2020.  When asked if we could move our date to 2021 to ensure it was safe and we wouldn't have to move our wedding a second time, they stood firm that this was not an option as we had to get married in 2020 (if our deposit was to go towards our wedding date).  They moved our date to a Sunday in a different month that is priced less due demand (they have 3 different tiers of pricing based on which month you select) but tried to charge us the same as they would have if we got married on a Saturday in a \"high demand\" month.  \n\nThis wasn't the only scenario where the Black Iris staff was not accommodating- they even scolded us for bringing in a small fruit salad for my 7 months pregnant bridesmaid as we got ready day of as \"no outside food or drink is allowed.\"  This was after we spent over $500 purchasing food and alcohol through them to enjoy while we got ready. I understand that event spaces have rules, but making a big deal about fruit salad, and taking part of our damage deposit because of it, seemed overkill to me. \n\nAt the end of the day, the Black Iris is a beautiful venue, but know what you are getting into as far as the level of service you can expect. Maybe I have high expectations, but the service level we received was pretty disappointing.","categories":["Wedding Planning","Event Planning & Services"]}

I ordered the Nasty Princess - an East Nasty with their spicy chicken instead of plain. Like others have said, the chicken isn't that spicy. It's definitely flavorful, and it's super crunchy on the outside, but it doesn't have a lot of heat. The biscuit and gravy was my favorite part--while the biscuit wasn't as flaky as I'm used to, it still tasted great and went well with the gravy. The chicken thigh was the size of my head, and I could only get through half of it. It's super oily, so be warned if you have a sensitive stomach.

The fish and chips were very good, not greasy but needed salt. The British dip sandwich was good except for the gravy which was heavy and in desperate need of salt. . The bangers and mash was a split decision; the bangers were great, meaty and flavorful. Problem is they were covered in the same uninspired gravy. So many things in need of salt and it cannot always be added after the fact.  The chef needs to add some to the gravy, salt the meat before cooking it; anyone who turns on The Food Network already knows this. For dessert we had the mocha cake (awesome), the creme brulee (very good) and the bread pudding which we sent back, not good.  Maybe they were going for savory, if so should have said on the menu.  It needed sugar like the gravy needs salt and was made with rye bread complete with caraway seeds. I like rye but not as a dessert.

{"stars":3,"text":"After reading a few rave reviews on Yelp, I was very excited to try Big Eye Raw Bar, the latest addition to date to Santa Barbara's ever evolving Public Market.\n\nThe Yelp photos of their food had my mouth watering and heart pumping in eager anticipation of consuming delicious, fresh fish, namely hand rolls! I am a huge fan of Los Angeles based Kazunori in Downtown LA, with its delectable hand rolls and simple menu. At first glance, Big Eye Raw Bar was reminiscent of that beloved sushi bar, unfortunately, in my experience they fell flat of meeting that expectation. \n\nLet's focus on the positive first. I love the remodel they did of the former I'a Fish Market. It's open, inviting and pretty incredible what the owners were able to accomplish in terms of maximizing seating in such a small space. \n\nThe staff were relatively attentive, nothing amazing in terms of customer service or enthusiasm but not negligent or rude either - just straight forward, \"what would you like\" \"here it is\" type of interaction. \n\nThough the menu is concise there is still variety and the food items read well on paper. I ordered two hand rolls to start, the Crab Hand Roll and Scallop Hand Roll. Prior to ordering, I clarified with the staff behind the bar whether the crab was imitation or real, and was relieved to learn it was real crab, Dungeness to be exact. \n\nWhen the rolls arrived the nori was soggy, moist and had adhered to the sticky rice like glue on both rolls which created an incredibly chewy barrier throughout the roll that could not be easily broken with teeth. Each roll was stuffed with rice, a slice of gobo and very little fish, perhaps a tablespoon each. The small portion of fish, however, did not mask the lack of flavor and freshness. The scallop was slimy and mixed with a few sprinkles of fish roe. The crab was very fishy and very watery. Edible but not tasty. \n\nThis glimpse into the food left me reticent to try anything else on the menu, so I opted not to order more and then went over to Corazon Cocina to finish my lunch. It's still in the early stages as the restaurant is brand new. There are some kinks to iron out, starting with the basic quality and execution of the hand rolls, and I am rooting for Big Eye that they'll get there. \n\nAt Kazunori for example, the hand rolls are served immediately as they are made and they are made to order each time. This allows the nori to retain its crisp texture. My rolls sat on the counter in the food prep area for about 5 - 10 minutes before the gentlemen serving me noticed them and brought them to the bar where I was sitting, along with another patron's food. Perhaps they were understaffed at the front of the house that day. A small variation like that can make a big difference with a hand roll.\n\nIt's a great concept and my sushi loving palette will certainly give it a go again after they've had more time to perfect their process. It's just not up to industry standard in my book at this time. A majority of the positive reviews that I have read mention their poke bowls, so if you're eager to try out Big Eye Raw Bar now that might be your best bet.","categories":["Japanese","Food","Live\/Raw Food","Poke","Restaurants","Sushi Bars"]}

{"stars":3,"text":"If oysters aren't your thing, I'd probably recommend skipping the Acme Oyster House. It's very touristy, and although the people who ordered the oysters loved their meals, the rest was just okay and not really worth the wait. \n\nWe went for lunch on a Saturday so obviously had to wait in line. They take your name and seat you based on arrival time, group size and whether your party is all present. With that being said, if you are actually standing in a line according to arrival time, it is frustrating to see the people behind you getting seated first, even if the restaurant is seating strategically based on party size. \n\nI wasn't super hungry so went with the seafood gumbo and rice & beans.  The seafood gumbo had some nice pieces of shrimp, however was a little bland. The rice & beans were good but also standard. \n\nIt was a packed house so it took a little while to get our food. Then it took a while to pay since they were having issues with the credit card machine. \n\nWith all of that being said, if you aren't into oysters, your time, calories and money are best spent elsewhere.","categories":["Live\/Raw Food","Seafood","Restaurants","Cajun\/Creole"]}

I ordered the lomo saltado, and at the recommendation of our server I got the \"mixed\" version. This wasn't on the menu, but he said it was very popular and was \"only a couple dollars more\". When we got our bills it was a bit shocking to see this mixed version with chicken, shrimp and beef was almost $10 surcharge on the \"normal\" lomo price. I felt somewhat misled and cheated.

Be warned if you dont like garlic they will not be your cup of tea. The flavor of the burger was honestly disappointing.

This place is a South Beach or Atkins dieter's nightmare with how good the warm biscuits that they bring to the table and if it's not bad enough with how good they taste, they keep bringing them as long as you have room on your plate.  We had the hot sampler, which was decent (and a great touch of deep fried jalapenos with the calamari) but contrary to the other reviews of this place, the crab cakes were mediocre at best and compare nothing to the ones you get actually out in Maryland.  The lobster bisque was well..... I couldn't put my finger on it and neither could anyone else that ordered it but it just wasn't right.  It was grainy and the flavor was slightly off.  The ahi tuna was a bit overcooked because I like mine RARE, basically cut straight from the fish and seared for 2-5 seconds each side for the chargrilled flavor and this was medium rare but the flavor was pretty good.  The dessert and wine selection from Steve (who absolutely rocked the mohawk, gave tremendous service and informed us that Tony's recently lost it's 5 star status) was superb, minus the fact that there were pecans in the chocolate velvet cake and the guy to my right is tree nut allergic but luckily had a small attack because he had a very small bite.  \n\nThe feeling of rich mahagony pillars, fine wooden bar and just dark enough made this place feel a bit like it should have been in a 50's mobster movie.

The box seemed to be bursting at the seams, barely containing what was inside. I was honestly afraid. These mythical beasts have a reputation for being large and in charge, and somewhat intimidating to most people, so we decided to leave it in the box until we got it home.\n\nAs it would turn out, all that build up was hardly necessary. What I thought was something dangerous turned out to be something to be admired and eaten! The box had a really heavy pizza inside, covered from edge to edge in copious amounts of ooey, gooey mozzarella, rich red sauce, very large pepperoni, and a towering crust! \n\nTurns out, as usual, the pics on Yelp don't lie. This pizza lived up to each and every one of them. That said, it could've been better. One easy fix is in this Pro-Tip: Ordering your pie well done is good move. It'll guarantee your pie is piping hot when you get it home and all that melty cheese will be nice and crusty on top, and melty beneath.\n\nThe reason for three stars here is that the crust:topping ratio seemed a bit off. The crust is delicious, but I think there's just a bit much of it. I realize this is something Pirate's is known for, so if you're a fan, this is my personal opinion.\n\nWould I return to Pirate's?

{"stars":3,"text":"My visit to T\u00e0nsu, a modern Chinese restaurant, was highly anticipated as I heard it was another creation of celebrity chef Maneet Chauhan. Located adjacent to Chauhan's Ale & Masala House, this venue is also very subdued from the outside but is gorgeous on the inside. The large two-story restaurant is dimly-lit with lotus candles on each table and brightly-colored lanterns hanging from the ceiling. The venue is very clean and modern. The ambiance is fantastic inside of here. \n\nI came here for a networking event which was hosted upstairs. It was a nice setting for this purpose and they have a bar upstairs. I ordered the Butterfly Lover (yes I hate myself for ordering a drink with that kind of name but it was worth it) which was sweet but not overly so with strawberry and basil. After mingling for a few hours upstairs a few of my friends and I decided to venture downstairs and stay for dinner. As it was late on a Tuesday night we put our name in and then were seated right away. \n\nOur waiter was attentive and encouraged us to share a few different plates. He told us that the name of the restaurant \"t\u00e0nsu\" means to explore in Cantonese, which he said was the point to order some dishes that you don't recognize. We ended up erring on the safer side but my group of 4 ordered the fire cracker wontons ($10), the Chinatown vegetable chow mein ($15), the General Tso's chicken ($18) and the lobster lo mein Cantonese ($27). My friend tried ordering the shrimp spring rolls but they said they were out of those. On accident they also brought us the Sichuan vegetables ($14) so we had this as well. My favorite out of everything was the Chinatown vegetable chow mein. It had good flavor and the vegetables in it were cooked well. Coming in at second favorite was the lobster lo mein, which was tasty but had tiny pieces of lobster (abeit from a large tail) in the dish so I wish I had gotten more of a seafood flavor. The wontons were very small and sadly I couldn't really get the flavor of the braised short ribs. The vegetables were spicy which was okay but then it had too many peppercorns in it. The chicken was probably my least favorite as the chicken was a bit tough and dry. I couldn't help but think that I've enjoyed Chinese food more at hole in the wall places. The food was okay but overall a letdown. \n\nI really wanted to like this restaurant as I am such a big fan of Maneet's, but sadly the food experience was a bit underwhelming for me. The ambiance and service was great and a 5\/5 but the food and the pricing of everything I would give a 3\/5. Overall, I would say this restaurant is a 3.5 rating. I would give it another chance but likely come for brunch or for just some of their other dim sum options.","categories":["Asian Fusion","Restaurants","Chinese"]}

Normally, I'd give these guys a solid 4 or 4 1\/2 stars, but our service tonight was just awful. I hope to god that this was our server's first night (though it was a Friday evening, so I doubt it) because otherwise, he just sucked. We ordered the bbq nachos appetizer, 2 waters and 2 1\/3 rib platters (staggered appropriately). We managed to eat almost 2 whole bites of our appetizer before our entr\u00e9es arrived. Seriously, there was, at absolute most, 3 minutes between our app and entr\u00e9es, essentially making our app a complete throw-away. Why they didn't stagger our order is beyond me. The appetizer is supposed to be both served and eaten before the entr\u00e9e, right? Isn't that server\/restaurant 101, appetizer BEFORE entr\u00e9e? When we were forced to abandon our nearly-untouched app, we faced 2 different problems (neither actually service-related, though). Her ribs were skimpy and overcooked, but mine were actually pretty perfect. However, both orders of fries were obviously the small, dark, burnt remnants of a previous batch and not fit to serve. Other than the lighting-fast progression from app to entr\u00e9e, our server took forever doing everything else. He only checked on us once, quickly and in-passing, with hands full of dishes. He never bothered to offer us a single refill until he was clearing our table (perfect timing). He took way longer than was necessary to bring us our check (while waiting on surrounding tables) and a box for our near-complete order of wasted nachos...and never asked about why we had so much left. I mean, really? No \"I see you haven't really touched this dish, was everything okay?\", nothing like that at all. Seriously, everyone screws-up, but a little interest or concern goes a long way. When he finally brought the check and box, he literally just stood there, hovering over us until we handed him back our ticket\/payment. Then, guess what...he took his sweet time bringing it back to us to sign. He was just unpleasant, awkward and bad at his job. It was, by far, the worst experience we've had here so far. We left visibly upset. We have to drive from Carson to eat here and, after tonight, the journey seems a lot less desirable to us.

It was a big portion size and I could only eat half of it, and let me tell you...I can eat a lot! \nHowever I believe it was the end of the experience where I was fairly disappointed. Now, when you do not want to keep your souvenir glass, there is a bar where you take it to in order to get your $4 back. When my mom and I went there to drop it off, the bartender was very dismissive and very unfriendly.

The kabobs were flame grilled and tasty, very healthy option also.  Their hummus and sauces are also delicious and very enjoyable, definitely also try the haloumi cheese appetizer, its a bit plain but if you are a cheese fan, especially a feta style cheese then you shouldn't miss this one.  \nThe service and wait times were the major problem.  \nWe went here on a saturday night and had to wait to be seated which is totally acceptable and expected for a weekend night for dinner.  The wait and complete lack of organization and poor service that occurred there after is where I take issue with this place.  \nThere were a total of 7 people working the foh between table service and running their pick up orders and even then all of them could not handle the volume.  Mind you this establishment is not that large so breaking up the tables into concise sections per server would be the optimal plan.  Simple best practices and common knowledge of working in and running a restaurant would immediately fix their problems.  We had our order taken by one person, food and beverages run to us by 4 different people, and then at the end sat waiting for quite a while to receive our check to pay even though there were a minimum of 6 empty tables at that point freeing up the service staff from the earlier rush.  \nIt is strictly based on the lack of organization and systems that makes this a slightly negative review, all of the staff were super polite and courteous the entire visit and the food was excellent.  \nTo the management:  Do a small amount of research on restaurant best practices, if you delegate specific roles and responsibilities to each of your front of house staff they will not be running around in chaos and everyone will know their tables and be able to serve them efficiently and properly.  You and your crew deserve accolades for politeness and for the quality and flavor of your food but the service issues due to ineptitude and lack of experience really hurt our visit.  \nI would still come back and try here again because we did really enjoy our meal.","categories":["Restaurants","Middle Eastern","Persian\/Iranian"]}

{"stars":3,"text":"If you've ever watched the Travel Channel especially episodes where people are traveling to the Far East you may have seen funny little fish salons like this one..where people get pedicures done by tiny little fish that nibble at your feet. Walking through the mall one day my daughter and I noticed the fish spa and thought we would go in to try it out. \n\nWhen we walked in we were immediately greeted by the owner who explained the fish don't actually nibble at your feet they more like \"vibrate all over\" your skin leaving your feet smooth and soft. My daughter, who loves any kind of animal scaly or otherwise, of course wanted to try it. We paid for 15 minutes of feet soaking time in the fish tank for each of us. \n\nWe were let over to two bench seats mounted above fish tanks. One of the \"fish tenders\" sprayed our feet and wipe them down so they were clean without contaminants before we put them in the water. Once we put our feet in the water the tiny fish swarmed all over our skin that was below water level. At first it tickled, then it tickled a little less and by the end of the 15 minutes I almost felt like it was starting to hurt. My daughter didn't even last the full 15 minutes. \n\nWhen we were done the \"fish tender\" slathered some lotion on to our feet which felt amazing. When I checked out the owner tried to sell me some of the same bottles of the lotion which I declined. Overall it was an interesting experience, but not one we would repeat. \n\nI will say the most fun part of this was watching all of the people walk by the store in the mall and gawk at everyone inside with fish all over their feet.","categories":["Beauty & Spas","Day Spas","Cosmetics & Beauty Supply","Shopping"]}

Probably the best cheap date I've ever been on.\n\nThere's a lot of choices for toppings; my Portuguese husband said the lingui\u00e7a was superb.  I am not much of an authority on lingui\u00e7a, but it was delicious.  The steak was good too.  I, for one, enjoyed the fibrous crust.  I've only had whole-wheat crust at one other place that was terrible.  Here, I didn't even notice it til I took a few bites and saw the dough was much darker than I'm used to.\n\nWe'll probably only go back during happy hour (4-6pm\/9-12am) because that's when the product matches it price.

Not too sweet from the honey, not to salty and the eggs were scrambled so they were not runny at all. I got to say runny eggs in a sandwich is just an unnecessary mess. On the side with my meal I had ordered the hash browns, which were kind of chard to the point where you could tell they were over cooked just from looking at them.\n\nMy fiance, had ordered the french toast. This is really what kind of ruined the experience. When they brought out our food she took one bite and said its cold.

However, we were surprised with the extremely limited quantity of sides that were included in our order when we opened it upon getting home. We were given 3 small pieces of corn, 4 small slices of potato, and several very thin slices of sausage.

{"stars":3,"text":"I had gotten my haircut here almost 4 or so months ago & to be honest, I was disappointed with the haircut I received at this location.\n\nThe hairstylist seemed rushed (she was doing a hair colour at the same time as doing my hair because she was apparently overbooked it seems) so I don't feel like she took that much care in to doing my haircut; no wash, shampoo or style at all. Apparently she prefers to \"dry cut\"; so she spritzed a little bit of water on my hair & went to town chopping off a good portion of it all.\n\nI asked for a specific cut & she did a straight cut in the back where it should have been more layered looking; I had to have her fix it by layering (which made it a lot more shorter in the back than what I had wanted) & even then when I got home to closer inspect, there were spots where my long hair still remained & it was uneven in the front.\n\nWith this last interaction here, I was iffy with returning however as I chose to get highlights, I decided to give them a second chance. When I called in on Thursday to book an appointment the receptionist was friendly enough, booked me in for today (Saturday) with a different stylist than previouslyso come today, I arrived early (I hate being late & when others are late), and was greeted by a woman at the front who advised me that my stylist wasn't there yet and that I'd have to wait. Okay, no problem, my appointment wasn't for another 15 or so minutes. I waited & waited, going past my appointment time, from there another woman advised me that the stylist was having car issues, so she was running late. Okay, fine; car issues happen. \n\nAbout 10 minutes or so after my appointment time, the stylist finally arrived and took me to the chair right away & went through what I was seeking (pretty thoroughly actually) & had me sign a waiver (I guess there have been issues with people trying to get out of paying full price for a service they received because of the economy;  no biggie, I signed it.) She began and made a bit of small talk,  but not much (which I love, because I hate small talk and awkward \"weather\" conversations.) I found her to be very thorough with explaining what she was doing & asking if I had concerns, etc. After the highlights were completed she washed & styled my hair, and that was that!

There was much less rice in the burrito this time, but it was properly cooked (not crunchy pieces like last time), there was a good amount of carnitas, but really only in the middle of the burrito, the first and last bites were mostly vegetables and\/or cheese. And the beans and guacamole were M.I.A. Maybe the sour cream was too, now that I think about it.  It still was a decent burrito, but it seems that they have a lack of consistency when making them.\n\nThe habanero salsa was really thick this time around. It almost had the consistency of canned chipotles in adobo. I mixed it with the milder salsa (which is too runny) to create a medium, slightly thick salsa.\n\nI got my order to go this time. One thing I noticed is there isn't really a good place to wait for your order, you are either breathing down someone's back while they are eating or in the way to the soda machine or the the salsa bar.  To go orders come with a little bag of chips, which is a nice touch. \n\nI do want to give them another (third) chance, but should go on a day when I really will try those tamales and pupusas and not just fall back to a burrito like I normally do.

They also assist checking on each other's tables. This was fantastic. They have a good selection of Mexican dishes on their menu, and the food is delivered FAST! \n\nHappy hour is all day everyday, and they have $5 patron margaritas and $2 beers.

I would have loved to give this place a 5 star rating but for me there are certain marks you must hit for Mexican food. The chips must be fresh, the salsa must be spicy, and the meat must be marinated! While the salsa had a decent flavor, it was by no means hot. However, the waitress was fantastic and brought me some roasted chilies to heat things up. The meat did not have a lot of flavor. I had ordered a carne asada chimichanga... It was not bad but lacked savoriness. Because of that I ordered a side of sour cream and guacamole. Unfortunately the guacamole was just as bland, fresh... But bland. The rice was lacking something as well. \n\nNow for their strong points... The green corn tamale... Delicious! The refried beans were great as well! In the future I would definitely make a return visit for the tamales. I'll have to try some more items off their menu before making a full judgement. The one thing I can say is that when I took my left overs I drenched the last half of my burrito in both of their salsas and it tasted like a whole different dish the next day and made it well worth it. \n\nOverall, this place is run wonderfully.

For instance, a pint glass for a beer that is supposed to be served in a tulip glass. Do not misunderstand me, I'm all for a bigger glass, if it's filled with beer. At City Tap House, however, the bartender will make a guess at what 12 oz looks like in a 16 oz glass.

How can a place that is obviously raking in the money in sales, be so miserly with the beer?

{"stars":3,"text":"Went to Goten on a recent trip back to Nashville - I like the new location (attatched to the Indigo Hotel on West End) much better than the old place on 21st - definitely a little more open and modern than the old, black booths.\n\nThe experience wasn't the best - probably because it was a night when all the Vandy sororities were having formals.  So, it was super busy with drunk undergrads - thankfully, I was never drunk and\/or disrespectful as a Vandy undergrad.  So, we ended up waiting for about a half hour after our reservation for our seats.  The hostess could have made it better by being friendly, she wasn't - and it seemed like she couldn't be bothered to deal with us.  She was over it!\n\nAnyway, once we got to our table they didn't have enough seats, so they tried to make 7 of us squeeze into a spot for 5.  But thankfully, our complaints were taken seriously and we were seated at another table.  \n\nThe food at Goten is pretty good - it's not the best hibachi I've ever had, but it does make a strong showing.  I also think the prices are pretty reasonable for the amounts of food you get.  \n\nIf the service was more attentive I would have given Goten another star - but I'm so over the hostess and her attitude.","categories":["Restaurants","Japanese"]}
{"stars":3,"text":"Good food, but terribly over priced for the area since they closed & reopened after the fire. $15 for a plate of carne asada tacos is ok, if you're upscale & located somewhere a little more posh,  but it's not upscale & it's here in Arnold...no. Just no. They even start charging for chips & salsa after the first basket. Which is whatever, but other places don't have to do that. I'm just saying. I recommend a place called Las Brias In Pevely. Menu is huge and has photos of everything, and the same tacos, but with more sides & sauces  are $5 cheaper. Plus you get all the chips and dip your heart desires. DO NOT OPT FOR THE FRESH GUACAMOLE. They just over charge you for a buffet of fresh ingredients, but you are essentially making your own guacamole. It's not mixed at all, which might be fun for some, but someone like my husband or sister would have no clue what to do to make their guacamole tasty. Stupid idea. I get it, but its no good. Some ideas are just better left uncreated.","categories":["Restaurants","Mexican"]}

Twice I leave because there's only so long I'm going to wait for breakfast on a whim.  They've lost my business twice because they say they are too busy outside but not inside.  I don't get it.  Give me a coffee and let me wait while I'm being caffeinated.  Ive never been to a popular breakfast place that was too busy yet had empty tables.

{"stars":3,"text":"When I first started coming here coffee was always made right and consistent. So far my coffee order has been messed up twice. I asked for a grande iced hazelnut latte with an extra shot. I was charged for it but when I received the coffee there was no extra shot. The cashier never wrote it on the cup. When I asked if there was an extra shot in the drink the barista told me, \"no its not written on the cup\" with annoyance and I understand you're busy, but I just wanted what I paid for. She proceeded to fix it and instead of remaking it she took my cup and poured the extra shot in an already completely filled cup. So when I closed the lid most of that extra shot spilled out. The second time was today. I went through the drive through and ordered the same drink. When I received my drink it was definitely clear looking and when I tasted it I knew it was made with skim milk, which I did not ask for. I was in a rush and didn't have time to ask for a remake. The barista who made the drink obviously wasn't paying attention to how the coffee was made because no where on my cup does it state I asked for skim milk. It sucks because I pay for good coffee. Lately it's been hit or miss.","categories":["Coffee & Tea","Food"]}

{"stars":3,"text":"So, we now have another Philadelphia restaurant migrating to Cherry Hill. As with F&F, they will learn they are in the burbs. The menu is just okay, somewhat limited really. I had the pork chop, which was good, including the potato pancake and red cabbage. Really well prepared. However, for the price, $21, I would expect a small dinner salad to go with it, but no. \n\nThe beers on tap are also somewhat limited and not particularly focused. I had a Goose IPA served in a midget pint glass. I then tried a Scottish ale, which was served in a half pint tulip, for $6.50. Having spent a lot of time in Ireland, I can tell you nobody gets a half pint put in front of them without ordering it, which I did not. They need to take ALL of these glasses and throw them out and start serving full beer portions unless they so state on the menu. Since I don't drink Guinness in the US, I cannot say whether they are also shorting it or using the new harp  imperial pint glasses Dubh Lin was using.\n\nThis was my first time I was here since they changed names (ownership changed a while ago). I was surprised to see the reception kiosk relocated with a wall that disallows a view of the bar when you walk in. Curious move to me. Not sure where this whole deal is headed, and will probably go back again, but from my take last evening, like F&F, they are not going to be very busy over the long haul except at peak times on weekends,","categories":["American (New)","Irish","Bars","Irish Pub","Restaurants","Nightlife"]}

So much so that when they assured me in 2020 their new reception venue would be completed by my October 2021 wedding date, I chose to release another venue I was seriously considering and booked with Rancharrah.  I had been reassured by 3 different employees that it would not be an issue for completion even if they ran into challenges during construction.  I had been checking on the progress continually, and again kept being promised it would be completed.  Unfortunately, I received a phone call a couple of weeks ago to let me know the venue would in fact not be completed, and at this time, they don't know when construction will begin.  I was completely heartbroken as all my plans had been made based on the esthetic of the property based on venue renderings, promises and assurances that shouldn't have been made.  Planning a wedding is stressful enough, and when you can't rely on the word and signed contracts of your vendors, it compounds that stress.  While we have had to change our date due to availability of a new venue, we will have a beautiful and memorable day despite this set back.  This venue will be amazing once completed; however, I would not sign any contracts or make any deposits until they have figured out what they are doing!","categories":["Active Life","Wedding Planning","Golf","Horseback Riding","Horse Boarding","Venues & Event Spaces","Pets","Country Clubs","Arts & Entertainment","Event Planning & Services"]}

I could barely hear the person I was with. They seriously need to invest in some noise dampeners for the walls. The service was friendly and helpful, but seemingly over worked. They had a huge amount of tables for 2 people. For some reason the only taste in the bean truffle soup was vinegar. Why??? The scallops and Gnoti were quite well cooked and very good. However, they were literally swimming in a lake of butter. Why??? The duck was flavored ala Duck a'la orange. Not exactly experimental flavors.

The drinks are great, I could spend all day here sipping bourbon (they have a fantastic selection and make a wicked Old Fashioned), but to be honest I don't care much for the food.\n\nMy first visit was with a group, so we got the platter with a number of sides. The only thing I really liked was the brisket, which was tender and crumbly and delicious. Other things I found the smoke flavour to be overwhelming, particularly for the pulled pork. The fried chicken I barely got to try because for some reason there's only one piece of fried chicken per platter (for 3-4 people, what are we supposed to fight to the death or something?), and we got a scanty rib piece. Not impressed. \n\nThe BBQ sauces I found very disappointing, they're all very sweet, even the \"spicy\". Maybe that's to cut the smoke flavour, but to me it's just all sweet smoke flavour. Yuck. \n\nThe sides were really underwhelming. The potato salad was really plain and boring, and almost dry. No one out of 8+ people in our group ate it. I'm not that big of a fan of garlic so the garlic fries were out, very strong garlic, kind of creamy.  Coleslaw was average. Veggie beans very dense and needing more flavouring. The mac & cheese was a hit, very creamy.\n\nWe came back a second time to try the sandwiches. I tried the pulled pork sandwich, but unfortunately my sandwich was ridiculously drowned with mayonnaise. I switched it with my bf who loves mayo but he couldn't finish it. It was a sloppy mess and again the pulled pork while tender did not have a great flavour in my opinion, I'd rather have a saucier spicier version.\n\nI'd only come back for a drink here, I think the food is disappointing. Great venue and the service has been very good, and the price is reasonable for what you get when you compare to other share style meat places like Rostizado ($50 a platter which feeds 3 people, versus $50+ per person to start).

I wish the pork belly was marinated and braised instead of just pan fried. Even though the ramen is not authentic, it still tasted good with lots of vegetables, and broth with depth and flavor. BUT, they didn't have red ginger, so I'm very sad - all good ramen shops carry this. Takoyaki was crispy and hot!\n\nSushi was half off with order of ramen, so that's cool!

Fish had a miso sauce on it that was so salty it was inedible. They took it off the bill. The duck was over cooked. \nIt was so hot inside, we were all literally sweating. We ended up turning down dessert and coffee because of it. They've got to get a grip on this before we get into the even hotter months. \nOn the charcuterie menu we got the baby octopus. It's our fault that we didn't ask how it was prepared, and assumed it would be grilled. It was out of a can. Just baby octopus in oil. \nSeating\/table was VERY uncomfortable. The chairs were metal and uncomfortable. And our metal table was so low that I couldn't cross my legs. Some will think that's no big deal, but the ladies will totally get it. \n\nI'd absolutely go back because they're doing some things really right. I'd go back in cooler months, sit on the patio, and just do smaller plates and charcuterie board with that insanely delicious pate and bread, and wine! And i saw that there were tables that weren't so low, and they had different kinds of chairs (wicker) that looked more comfortable.

A few little complaints (not bad enough to stop me from going on a fairly regular basis): the rewards card has an annual fee (not worth it to me in that case) and it isn't the type of nail salon that makes the effort to remember the frequent customers.

Therefore, we waited quite a long time for our food, even though our area wasn't crowded. It's kind of jarring to be charged for refills of iced tea, too.

{"stars":3,"text":"Tiny seats, microscopic tray, no pocket but otherwise fine!\n\nOk.  First of all, this is a budget friendly airline.  You're made aware of any additional charges before you ever book your flight.  Pay attention to the details and there should be no misunderstandings.  Prepare yourself ahead of time, and you can still get a decent flight for a great rate. \n\nWe'd never flown Spirit before a recent trip from Tampa to New Orleans.  We knew the additional costs for checked bags, carry ons, in flight snacks, etc.  We made a plan and decided one checked bag would be plenty for us so we prepaid the fee, saving some money.  If you check your bag at the airport without prepaying, it costs more.  As far as carry on bags, we didn't need any because you still get a free personal item per person, as long as it fits under the seat.  And snacks? The flight was barely over an hour.  We were fine without them.  \n\nAll of the staff for both of our flights with Spirit were delightful from the flight attendants to the gate check.  And the particular plane we had on both trips was brand new; or at least it looked like it was new. \n\nThere are a couple of \"bells and whistles\" I do miss from the pricier airlines.  An actual pocket on the back of the seats is nice.  These flights had a bungee cord holding the paperwork in place.  I know it sounds trivial but I did miss having a spot to tuck away my water bottle within reach.  And the tray is tiny.  It was the size of my Galaxy tablet; super small.  But again, it's not like we were having a full course meal and needed the space or anything.  The seats and arm rests are smaller than what I remember but for a short flight, it's fine.  Also, do note that the weight limit on checked bags for Spirit is actually 40 pounds; we were thinking it was 50 and had to do some rearranging.  \n\nOverall, we were pretty happy with Spirit.  It's a huge discount and everything went as well as could be expected.  The flight to New Orleans was actually the smoothest from take off to landing that I think we've ever had!  We'd fly with them again for sure, for a short flight like this one.  I'm not super sure I'd do it for a long flight, simply due to the comfort level, but I wouldn't totally rule it out, either.

Maybe a little light on star anise and spices but well developed. \n\nGood: Rare beef and fatty beef were good...standard thin sliced meats and well portioned. Tendon was very good. Had just the right softness and no crunch but held together. Good quantity of rice noodles and not over cooked. Good amount of Thai basil and sprouts and jalape\u00f1o. \n\nBad: tripe in pho was not well enough soaked and cleaned so it retained too much barnyard flavor. \n\nGood: summer rolls had a good amount of herbs and peanut sauce was nicely made. \n\nBad: the tamarind wings...inedible...one bite and the taste and smell of turned\/old chicken permeated my sinuses.

Now, my wife works in the restaurant business and is from Southeast Asia, and i am extremely familiar with food and Vietnamese cuisine...use tamarind regularly in my kitchen, and we both know turned chicken when we smell\/taste it. Disappointed that the chef couldn't tell or wouldn't admit. \n\nBad: table had sriracha, hoisin, and sambal, but no chili oil.

I honestly have not had a burger this good in a really really long time; it had sprouts (which i took from my salad and put on the burger :) ), lettuce, tomato, onion, ketchup and mustard (my fave burger accompaniments) and although it sounds like a small thing to have a really juicy burger for most people, it's no small thing for a vegan. Many times people just think we don't eat, but I am thankful to O'Bistro because of this burger and definitely recommend it.

I had heard about the restaurant a couple of times and read online that it's a really great Mexican restaurant, but I don't think it deserves so much hype.\n\nGoing in it reminded me of Chipotle a bit where you order your food, watch them assemble it in front of you and while they do it they make sure to ask you if you want all the associated ingredients of what you ordered. The menu was definitely different from Chipotle, however. Most notably they have shrimp and fish as meat options.\n\nSince I was in New Orleans I went with the Baja Tacos that only come with fish or shrimp. I also ordered a side of flautas since I had never had them before and thought why the hell not. I found the prices to be a little on the high side competing with boutique taquerias in Chicago. They weren't absurd though.\n\nThe food was made quickly and served to me. I walked over to the condiment area and was pleasantly surprised. They had numerous salsas and toppings. I grabbed some sort of red salsa and some pickled onions (my Mexican partner recommended the onions for the flauta). \n\nI have to say that the flautas disappointed me. I'm not experienced with them, so I don't know if they were prepared the right way, but they just reminded me of some frozen food aisle Mexican food that my family would get me as a kid. There was hardly any meat and mostly it was just the crunchy shell.\n\nThe tacos were ok. The fish tacos did not exactly have as much flavor as I had hoped and they reminded me of an average taco place in Chicago. Nothing wrong with them, just no wow factor. The shrimp tacos were better. The shrimp was decently sized and tasted fresh. I gotta say that the hero here was the salsa I grabbed. It had a delicious smoky flavor to it which I don't think I've had in a salsa.\n\nOverall it was just an ok restaurant.

Miller (JAM) Catering rather than reflexively react so close to the Wedding Day.\n\nJAM catered our wedding at the John James Audubon Center in Audubon, PA. This incredible venue required the use of JAM.  Let me begin by mentioning a few positives ... the JAM tasting during the lead-up to the wedding was a well-run event.  The food at the tasting was good (although they presented options that you wouldn't generally have at a wedding, like salmon pad thai).  Also, JAM staff were quite accommodating when adapting a family recipe for use in our wedding menu (although they got it right for our private tasting, they veered from the recipe the day of our wedding, making it salty and using substitute ingredients).  They also coordinated closely with the bakers to deliver an excellently-designed cake.\n\nThere were certainly some negatives; these outweighed the positives.  Generally, customer service was woefully below average, especially given the cost.  There's a level of expectation when one is spending considerable sums of money and JAM just didn't rise to the occasion.  We were provided a \"day-of coordinator\" (Sue) who was supposed to work closely with Shannon, and yet there was discontinuity.  We were extremely relieved to have hired a our own wedding coordinator that worked the day of.  Neither JAM staff person was particularly helpful leading up to our big day.  Their communication was sporadic and at one point, in the two weeks leading up to the wedding, they didn't respond at all to emails (we received a response from Sue a few days before our wedding explaining that she was on vacation, yet there was no automatic away message).  We were also promised quite a few things (most likely to calm our nerves) prior to the wedding that weren't delivered on.  This level of services was certainly not a way to impart calmness to the stressful situation of wedding planning\/preparation.\n\nSo, would I avoid the John James Audubon Center because JAM is the required caterer? No.  The venue is too gorgeous.  But, I certainly would temper your expectations on the client-facing\/customer service end of JAM Catering.  Expect nothing special, which is wholly disappointing given the cost.","categories":["Caterers","Event Planning & Services","Venues & Event Spaces"]}

{"stars":3,"text":"An \"Irish\" neigborhood bar, The Bishop's Collar is a serviceable location to grab a beer on your way somewhere else.\n\nIf you've perused my other reviews, you know I have a bias for Irish bars - I'm not sure if it's the ambiance or just prejudice, but the Guinness always seems to taste better. Needless to say, I was predisposed to like The Bishop's Collar when I arrived there on a Saturday night after 9pm. It's a small narrow establishment, with a long bar along the right wall and tables in the back, and the place was packed. They pour a good Guinness here and the prices are reasonable. However, unlike other Irish bars, they don't have some of the favorites on tap, such as Harp, Bass or Magners, so don't expect any Black & Tans or Half & Halfs. In fact, most of the beer they have on tap aren't really Irish at all, which is a little disappointing as the bar advertises itself as Irish. I'm a stickler for that sort of thing, so if you're just looking for a good draft list and a deep bottle list, you probably won't be as disappointed. Unlike the other reviewers, we had no problem with service, never having to flag down the bartender and I don't think I saw the bottom of my glass the whole night.\n\nOverall, it's barely an Irish bar and more of just a standard neighborhood bar. I'd like to see more of an Irish spin on the draft list other than Guinness. If they do that, this would easily be a four star establishment.","categories":["Nightlife","Bars","American (New)","Burgers","Restaurants"]}

{"stars":3,"text":"2-3 star at best.  I will try again as this was my first time last night.  Couldn't wait to try this restaurant as a friend in Newtown had been to your sister restaurant many times and your location once prior and said it was really good.    But, i have to say we had a few issues. My friend was totally shocked as this was the first time it was truly not good for her either.    Hopefully this note will help you do better as I did like my meal and thought it was very tasty.  The real  issue was the server - perhaps it was just a bad night or she was too busy (that happens), but she was not a very friendly waitress at all.   If a server is busy or they know things may take a bit longer - just be honest and friendly and at least offer to refresh drinks while waiting?    But... The one issue  that you really need to address ASAP is how your servers bring food out.  Use a tray please.  She carried glasses out. She even carried my miso soup out and my friends salad.  I don't want someone's fingers or thumbs in my soup - ugh! I did see other servers carrying trays so if you need more, get more please!  soups, salads, drinks and side sauces shouldn't be carried out alone.   it's much classier to use trays.  Also, the dinner was not hot.  People mostly like their dinners hot, not luke warm.  Like i said , it was good and I didn't send it back because it was very busy and chalked this all up to her inexperience and lack of staffing perhaps.

The meat was delicious, it's just a shame there was so little of it. I paid $2 extra for a tiny blob of sour cream and guacamole. \n\nMy friend had the salmon which came smothered in a cream sauce.

The $12 locker did not fit my hand luggage which was annoying. I was too paranoid to leave my stuff around, so I always gotta locker. You aren't able to open and see the depth of the locker before u pay for it, so keep that in mind. There is a mirror behind the lockers in the ladies bathroom which is not a great idea. Some could watch another person signing in in the mirror. \n\nThe bathroom\/changing room: I went to the waterpark thurs, fri, and Sat. The ladies toilets were really gross on Saturday. One stall didn't have a lock, some didn't have toilet paper, and others just gross. \n\nAt one point the elevator wasn't working on Saturday (seemed to be quickly fixed though). Ironically, the day I had my luggage...kind of seems like Saturday is the day to avoid. I tried to avoid the weekend all together, but the park was closed Monday afternoon, tues, and Wed the week I had vacay. \n\nThe food: Do not get the bucket of tenders and fries. That's a horrible idea. Soggy, fries. Just no. The tenders were decent. The pizza was ok. The type little kids like. They sell Cheesecake Factory cheesecake. I tried the original flavor. Not bad. The prices are reasonable. $3 for a slice of pizza isn't out of control. \n\nSometimes I would have to wait a while at the life jacket station before someone showed up to help. I don't think it ever took more than 5 minutes of waiting.\n\nDue to reading reviews, I was on the lookout for roaches. I saw one around the tables on Friday, and another one in the bathroom on Saturday. If there are two, there are more...\n\nThe basket ball pool area was closed most of the time we were there.

I like to buy whole spices and grind them myself to make blends, and Harvest Market is the best place in northern Delaware to buy my spices in bulk. They're much cheaper than supermarket spice sections and even better than Newark Farmer's Market, I think. Unfortunately, they don't have sumac or Szechuan peppercorns, but I was pleasantly surprised to find fenugreek. They also offer a decent assortment of looseleaf tea there; they don't have a huge variety, but the quality is good and the prices are very reasonable. This is in contrast to the rest of the store, where everything seems to be very expensive.\n\nUnfortunately, when I went there yesterday, my boyfriend and I had to listen to some smug employee lecturing other customers for like half an hour on the Evils of the American Diet (processed foods, GMOs, gluten, our Paleolithic ancestors would never have eaten this, etc).

{"stars":3,"text":"Been here twice so far - was at their first semi-opening and once last weekend. \n\nFirst, the non-factors but still worth mentioning. \n\nWait time for food was slow  (on the first day) but acceptable on the second visit. Service is friendly and cheerful. Some guy came out to apologize for the long wait on the first day and asked for feedback - I assume he was the owner? At least he cared enough to interact with us.\n\nAs for quality of service, I was perfectly fine with getting my own stuff from the counter on the first day so I could spend what would've been my tip on extra toppings. Going forward though, the place may only have 1 or 2 servers (if any?) Decor was minimal and nothing particularly fetching. Chairs were ok. No actual \"paper\" menu - just a whiteboard with a variety of choices (shio, shoyu, miso, spicy miso) and toppings (extra chashu and egg).\n\nPrices were more appropriate - about $8 without toppings for the regular sized ramen. Nice!\n\n******  On to the food\n\n\nBroth - both visits were acceptable, though I went with a sorta-semi-more subtle shio option the 2nd time vs the shoyu option. Not heavy at all - perhaps in between light and medium. A reasonable amount of flavor but missing a certain oomph or impact. I've had some fatty ramens that gave me some chest\/heart pains - no joke!  And this place was not one of them.  5\/10.\n\nNoodles - both times were acceptable. Seemed cooked about right for my liking, though I prefer mine softer cooked vs \"al dente\".   5\/10. \n\nCha-shu - 1st time it was excellent. Tender and \"melty\" 8\/10. 2nd time around it was not so good, but not terrible. Was chewy. It also appeared to be a different color (white vs brownish) but I could be remembering the first batch incorrectly. Not sure if something was rushed or a different cut of meat was used?  3\/10. \n\nToppings - the menma tasted a little off, which (according to another reviewer) may be from the canned source. Not sure if I like the red ginger in my broth. Don't remember any nori sheets either (which I thought was standard usually). 4\/10. \n\n****** \n\nOverall, the general taste is reminiscent of Santouka (which according to the internets is a part of the owner's  Ramen background). But it's cheaper and hell of a lot closer than driving to NJ. Assuming they can replicate my first time visit's food, I would certainly come again. To recap, a 5\/10 and here's to hoping for improvements!\n\nAs for alternatives, there aren't many right now. Although ... you can check out my (and many other people's) Ramen Boy review if you'd like. I more or less hammered the place. \n\nYea, it might've improved since my last visit.... But I decided I would not give the place another try on my own dime after they hustled me and dining companions with some pretty shoddy product that took way too long to prepare\/present. Yes, it was opening day (or 2nd day I forget). Yes, my fault for not manning up and complaining right then and there I suppose. Then again, I've never had THAT many things wrong with the food that'd merit a \"let me talk to your manager\"...","categories":["Restaurants","Japanese","Ramen"]}

{"stars":3,"text":"Recommended by a friend, we came here for a brunch... but by the time we got there we were pretty much in the lunch time. This place was packed and on top of that we had to wait pretty much 30ish minutes for a table. After getting seated we looked around and marveled at the hype. I think the decor was interesting, as well they modeled everything after an old school grocery... obviously. \n\nWe sat down and I saw another table that ordered orange juice, which made me think that it would have probably been fresh and hand squeezed. When I asked the waiter he didn't say it was hand squeezed, but it was delivered and it was fresh. When we tasted the orange juice, let's say it was fresh as in it didn't go past that expiration date. But, seeing it from his point of view, I think he sold it? Another thing that I noticed was that well, it seemed that we weren't getting as well of service as other tables. For instance, cup of water wasn't refilled, the waiter didn't come by often or ask how we were doing, however we saw him stop by other tables and have nice conversations with other patrons. \n\nEnough about the service, because we all know it's all about the food. So what did I order? I got a Tennessee Philly with brisket. It was served au jus, which was pretty interesting as I guess this would have been the spin on the normal philly cheesesteak. The GF got the King's French Toast... I'm more of a savory person so I didn't really partake in the dish. However, coming from her she enjoyed it. \n\nOverall, there seems to be a lot of hype here, but to me it's just okay. There's nothing extremely amazing or eye popping. I did want to note that there is a brunch during the weekends? I'm assuming because I didn't ask any questions about it. But yeah, this place isn't bad, but isn't really special other than the nice decor and feeling of this place.

{"stars":3,"text":"Harvest was recommended by a friend.  This restaurant is at a new location in Tucson, and it offers really nice views of the city lights after dark.  Reviewing what the 5 of us ate is somewhat  irrelevant because all of the entrees were tremendously liked by all of us.  Notably, the pistachio cream pasta was delectable with the chicken addition.  Between us, we ordered a number of desserts, and the only small complaint we had was that the red velvet cupcakes were somewhat dry.\n\nNow, getting to the service.  Our party of five did not arrive together (3 and 2), so by the time the second couple came, the first 3 of us had already ordered drinks.  The first drinks finally showed up after about 15 to 20  minutes (the second couple had arrived by then and  ordered their drinks when the first drinks came).  Then, it took about another 15 minutes for their drinks to come (which made it inconvenient as we wanted to toast to a birthday and the first drinks melted significantly by then).\n\nOur waitress (Amy) was very friendly, joking with a couple of us as we ordered, but after taking our orders and serving our waters, we rarely saw her.  We actually had to catch her walking by to order a second drink (which we felt lucky to get at all, as it took another 20 minutes to get them delivered, and we were practically finished eating).  We  probably would have had 3 or 4 rounds of drinks had she been more attentive, as we were celebrating an occasion.  She never did come back to fill our waters after the 1st time.  Our food was served in two parts (3 of our plates delivered first and then about 10 minutes later, the 4th and 5th plates were delivered.  Not wanting to start eating without all the food being at the table first, the first 3 plates delivered cooled down considerably.\n\nMaybe there was a staff shortage the evening we were there, but the food was well worth going there again.  We will certainly give this restaurant another chance, hoping that the service will be better.","categories":["Salad","Restaurants","American (New)"]}
{"stars":3,"text":"Let me just say I was super excited when I heard this restaurant was opening in Downtown Tampa. I had been travelling to Saigon Deli (North Tampa) and Jade Bistro (St. Pete) just to get my hands on some bad ass banh mis. Went with a small group of friends during the lunch hour. A friend ordered a Beef Pho: the broth was tasty but warm. That was a no no. Another friend ordered the same thing: the broth was nice and hot but found other types of meat in the Pho. As for me, I ordered a Grilled Pork banh mi and Avocado fresh rolls. The food quality was great. The banh mi bread was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside as a baguette should be and my Avocado fresh rolls were good but I wish there were larger pieces of avocado and some carrots to give the dish more color. The peanut sauce was delish! Now, my problem was this: I waited almost an hour for my banh mi. \nI really want this place to grow and become a staple in the downtown area. Normally fusion restaurants drop the ball somewhere but all the food was on point. Here's what I'd like to see \"Fusion Bowl\" improve on:\n1. Service: I know they just opened and are looking for staff but this will help plenty. Dishes were left on tables for quite a while and the food runner had to deliver the food, get people certain things, and pick up the dishes. This place needs a food runner, 2 waiters to take care of the floor, and a good bus boy\/girl to clean up after and they'd be set. So if you know of anyone looking for a job send them over there.\n2. Communication: A lack between register and kitchen. Hopefully in time an electronic system along with the printed system?\nAlso, the number holders on the table should be taller, the food runner had to come and ask around for numbers because she couldnt see them. \n3. Decor: Props on this. Very trendy. However, it would be nice on all the tables (minus the coffee table) for there to be an individual set of the sauces, hoisin, sriracha, and napkin holder. Also, chopstick quality seemed a little cheap. They were flaky, not sure what word to use, but could definitely lead to blisters. \nThis place has tremendous potential and I really want it to grow, kick off, and hopefully do well enough to stay open later. Maybe even a late night? To dream. I only gave them a 3 star because of the service because the food was fantastic.

As the 3 stars show, it was just okay. I'll give the restaurant props of the funky decor, the very friendly service, and the $1 mojitos. My mom's filet was WAY overcooked, and the staff handled it very well (new steak and no charge). The food, however, was just okay. I had some pasta with a cream sauce and shrimp...good flavor (I liked the added bacon) but nothing special. I guess I was just expecting a more creative menu. So overall, it was a good experience but a bit lackluster in the food department. I think its worth going back to give it another try if the menu changes...I'll write another review if I do!","categories":["Restaurants","Party & Event Planning","Event Planning & Services","American (New)","Cajun\/Creole"]}

Sure, the pizzas aren't that great, but for a quick meal, it's not a bad deal.

Level 2 was just enough because if you go to level 3 you will be sweating (in my opinion). \n\nOnly downside is we ordered 2 yellow curries and got 2 different ones.

Well, she did file them down but not enough even when I asked.  My nails afterwards felt bulky and heavy.

Ninety percent of the decorations have a Philadelphia theme.  The walls are covered in oil paintings of the Philly skyline.\n- The service was good.  Our waitress was very pleasant and didn't rush us on making drink or meal selections.

Filled with lump crab and contained minimal fillers.\n- The short rib sandwich was excellent.  A juicy sandwich complimented by a very mild horseradish sauce.  I also enjoyed the side salad that accompanied the sandwich.\n- The menu offered some great options and very reasonably priced for a city restaurant.\n\nAreas of Opportunities:\n- The chairs that are pitted with the high tops are a tad too short for the tables.\n- The beer list was decent however the list on the table didn't include some of the seasonals on tap.  \n- Pest control (see below)\n\nBack to the fruit flies, they were unbearable!

{"stars":3,"text":"I'm visiting from Az and came here for a tan before heading back home. I called the day before and the girl told me it was too busy to come that day so I went the next day after making an APPOINTMENT! The girl the next day ( not the same girl ) told me SHE HAD SOMEONE IN 15 minutes with an appointment! I was like ???????   Okay??????? Anyway. She took her slow ass time typing in every little thing asking for my drivers license while looking outside ( telling me if the other lady comes she will go before me ) I'm like?? Girl if you hurry the hell up it will take me 5 minutes, ANYWAY the girl on the phone said the tan cost 35 dollars.. the website said 27... I paid 45. the tan I got was a purple undertone tan... it was the medium color because the woman at the counter would not let me get any darker of a color. The color is pretty so the only complaint I have is that I wish it were darker because this shit washes off ... I repeat this shit washes off... And I get the darker color at my regular place. Anyway she looked me up and down and was like ... I get the lightest one because I'm light ... ( insinuating I should get the lightest one) at my Tan place everyone just gets the dark one because in a few days it will be light anyway. But whatever. The thing that bothered me the most is how she totally treated me like trash and then without looking up from her computer she pointed at the bowl of shoes and said \" you get a free pair of flip flops, those are all we have left so I hope it's your size \" there were two pairs of shoes both the size 8, I'm a size 6. She didn't even care to accommodate... she really didn't even leave room for me to ask if there were any other free shoes in my size ( this place has a bunch of other shoes and shirts etc) I didn't ask because she was acting like a snobby brat from moment 1. No use. The one good thing is she went back with me and explained the steps nicely and quickly and showed me the poster that tells you the steps if I forgot. Anyway. I didn't appreciate not being prioritized and I'm still wondering if I paid an extra 10 dollars for \" free shoes \" that wouldn't fit me.","categories":["Beauty & Spas","Spray Tanning","Tanning"]}
{"stars":3,"text":"We ate here because I had a Groupon, and we were interested in trying Miguel's. I hadn't heard much about Miguel's, yet after eating here, I agree with Meighan that the restaurant could get five stars for the food, but the service was so totally and completely lacking- that I can't bring myself to give it more than three stars. And I feel three stars is being generous... I've honestly had nicer and friendlier service at McDonalds. \n\nMy husband and I arrived at the restaurant at about 8 PM Friday night for dinner. The restaurant was only half full, and yet, we were treated like it was 10 PM and we were the last table they were going to seat before closing. It took 10 minutes of standing at the hostess podium to get a table. The hostess was a little hot head, and I didn't appreciate her negative attitude. After waiting for over 10 minutes, when she finally seated us, she took us to a table in the middle of the restaurant. We asked for a booth, and were told, \"There are no booths that are ready.\" There was clearly a booth available, it just hadn't been reset. When I gestured and said, \"What about that one?\" She replied with a sarcastic shrug, \"Well, it's going to be a few minutes...\" As I watched her pull settings from a different table to move them, I questioned myself about even staying to eat here. After her mini-tantrum of having to set the booth, she set the menus down on the table, and walked away. She didn't even smile, or say anything. OKAY?! I shouldn't have to feel like a leper for asking for a booth, and not wanting to sit in the middle of the half-empty restaurant? This wasn't starting well...  \n\nThe waiter and the bus boy weren't much better than the hostess. We had to ask the other hostess for chips and salsa. The bus boy brought them, and set them on the table without even making a comment. We had to ask for water, then more water- every time we needed water. I even had to ask for the wine list! What? Why didn't the hostess give us the wine list when we were seated? Any plates that needed to be cleared during out meal had to be put to the front of the table to get the waiter to pick them up. The restaurant itself is charming, and the decor is fresh, with a Carribean\/Mexican style feel. Yet, any possible charm and style was completely lost on me because I kept trying to figure out what we did to 'deserve' such horrible service. \n\nBy the way, if anyone even remotely cares about the front of the house staff and how they are treating their customers, I hope they read this review. A front of the house staff with such total lack of disregard towards customers overshadows any greatness in the quality of the food, and comes across as a complete turnoff. The food was definitely two thumbs up, with a great presentation and very flavorful. I had the chicken mole, which is not a traditional mole, but more like a pesto mole. It was cooked perfectly, and served on a bed of flavorful white rice and veggies. My husband had the Sea bass, which was also cooked perfectly and served on a bed of white rice with the same veggies as the chicken. My husband's comment about the food was, \"This is one of the best meals we've had in Tucson in a long time.\" We also enjoyed the piano player- a very nice touch. \n\nIt's too bad for Miguel's... They could have a great restaurant, but the lack of service and negative (almost surly) attitudes of the staff were a complete turnoff. Not sure I have a desire (or the stomach) to go back. Based on the way the staff treats their customers, I'm probably not the only one who feels this way. Miguel, if you care at all- HIRE A COMPETENT MANAGER, and get your staff in-line, because whoever is in the kitchen knows how to cook.","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}

Although the place was less than half full they were already out of or low on items on the menu. \n\nThe server did not let us know when we sat down that certain items were low so that if we were interested in those to let him know so he could reserve them.  Instead we sat and had appetizers and cocktails and by the time we ordered dinner they only had 2 pork shanks left ( not enough for those in our party that wanted them).\n\nThe table next to us came a half hour after us and placed their orders for the shank, which left us short.  Very disappointing and avoidable.  They told us they cook it ahead of time an only have a limited number available.

{"stars":3,"text":"Had high hopes, as this was highly recommended by locals.  Long wait for a table and a long wait for food, but there are highlights:  four of us ordered the barbecued chicken.  Very tender and juicy, but reviews of the sauce ranged from too tame to meh.  The brisket and ribs both drew thumbs up.  Barbecue Salad with brisket was declared okay and the fried fish got a passing grade.  Reaction to the sides was mixed as well: cheddar grits were scrumptious, cole slaw nicely crisp, good potato salad, great dirty rice and ok BBQ beans.  Sweet potato crisp may as well have been dessert.  Cornbread was tasty, not too sweet. \n\nBiggest criticism of the menu:  limited fish offering (fried or shrimp and grits), only one vegetarian burger, no fresh veggies (other than salad), no cooked greens. \n\nOverall, pretty good food,  but be prepared to wait for both your table and your meal!","categories":["Breakfast & Brunch","American (Traditional)","Barbeque","Cafes","Restaurants"]}

{"stars":3,"text":"This review is just for the restaurant.\nWe had breakfast, lunch and dinner.\nlet's break it down as it should:\n-Human element: 5 solid stars. Service is spectacular, the staff is absolutely charming, attentive, educated but not stiff, upbeat (thanks Nathan!). The restaurant manager came to check how were we doing and to say hello and he was delightful and informative, classy and at the same time warm. Thanks Mario, you are a credit to the hotel and restaurant.\n-Setting: excellent, five stars\n-Food: BLEH. Uninspiring, boring, mediocre, traditional hotel food. No doubt many guests will be ok with this colorless menu, but you are a five-star hotel that excels in so many aspects, and some of your guests are sophisticated enough to enjoy a creative menu, don't you think? at least one or two menu choices off-the-beaten-to-death path?\n-Music: we were mercilessly punished by a singer for the duration of our dinner (beware, Fri and Sat). What in heaven has this thing of the stuffy, dull past has to do now in a place like this? THE PIANIST WAS EXCELLENT. Have him play softly, that would be great. This singer that won't stop was even being broadcast through the speaker system, so in spite of asking to be seated as far away as possible, we HAD to endure him nevertheless. Suggestion: you want to listen to the singer (for whatever incomprehensible reason): go to the lobby. You want peace (that's what you were looking for at the Belmond, peace and charm) go outside... IF THEY WOULD ONLY NOT HAVE HIM ON THE SPEAKERS TOO. Easy solution. \nOur stay in the hotel, though, was solid Five Stars, and that will go in a separate review.","categories":["Restaurants","Event Planning & Services","Hotels","Hotels & Travel"]}

Of course, shoes on shoes on shoes we're on sale. Heaven. \nI made my way to the far right side and started to look. A gentleman in the shoe section asked if I needed help, I said no and he lurked off. Weird\nI got to the area where a bunch of racks were, and started trying shoes on. I found a couple I liked and two that I wanted a different size in. I asked sandy for one shoe in a different size. She was busy and said she would get it shortly. No big deal. I continued to browse. She came back w the size I needed I was thrilled.  I got another pair and was gonna ask her again for a different size, but she wasn't around. There was a brown headed girl, so I asked her. She rudely told me I could not get another size bc it was on a sale rack and that's all they had.  Weird, that I had just gotten another size from another lady. But whatever. I brushed it off and went upstairs to juniors section. I stayed upstairs for a while before I came back down to pay. \n\nI didn't want to pay in shoe dept, rather I walked over to the jewelry counter to pay. Linda was super sweet and acknowledged me.

Sure, they offer the requisite 5+ page menu with a bazillion choices and serve tasty sandwiches, but that's where the similarities end.\n\nFirst of all the atmosphere is more \"diner\" than deli with (dusty) faux plants and cheesy posters on the walls.  Service is very slow despite there not being many customers on a Sunday afternoon, and our waitress kept mixing up orders between tables in her section.  \n\nAs for the food, I had a bowl of the chicken noodle soup and was not impressed.  The broth tasted homemade but they completely skimped on the chicken - 4 or 5 tiny pieces in the bowl, with a whole bunch of noodles and one or two small carrots - certainly not \"loaded with chicken and vegetables,\" as the menu states.  Based on my meal, the atmosphere and the service I would have given TooJay's 2 stars but they earned one more star with their sandwiches.  The TooJay's Classic sandwich was good and very large for the price, loaded with tasty pastrami and corned beef.  I didn't really like the way the meat was sort of all rolled up together on the sandwich, but other than the presentation I can't complain, and it was admittedly cheaper than what you would pay in New York.\n\nOur waitress brought us 2 of the mini black & white cookies at the end of our meal as an apology for the slow service and mix-ups we had experienced earlier, which was a nice gesture but the cookies tasted dry and stale.  They had a whole case of pretty looking pastries and cakes at the front of the restaurant, but after the awful cookies I wouldn't have high-hopes for any of the rest of their desserts.\n\nAll in all I might go back if should find myself at International Plaza craving a sandwich, but only if I had plenty of time and patience.","categories":["Event Planning & Services","Restaurants","Caterers","Sandwiches","Delis"]}

{"stars":3,"text":"This place is a little bit over-hyped and has become sort of a disappointment.  Been to this new location a few times; the last time being about 2.5 years ago. I always thought Mr. Dunderbak's was pretty extraordinary. But went this past Friday night and right off the bat it started bad. Serious parking issues at this location but I won't fault Mr. Dunderbak's for this. But be warned, you might have to park at the lot across the street to get inside the restaurant. Before being seated, my girlfriend had to use the restroom and she came out with a frightened look on her face and explained that there were a bunch of flies in the restroom and around the kitchen area (more on this later). Some good housekeeping\/managing hints and words of advice - please provide more drink menus for all the tables. We had to beg the people next to us to borrow theirs (we sat at a communal fest-haus bench). I mean how hard would it be to provide 2-3 beer menus for each fest-hause table? And same goes with the mustard. I had to get up and steal some mustard from another table. Plus, the mustard wasn't labeled. So you didn't know if you had spicy brown, German, honey mustard, etc. \n\nAs for the food. Ehhh, not bad but not really that good. Their reubens (and variations of it) are just par. Trust me when I say, The Lucky Dill has not only much better tasting reubens but you get way more and for about the same price. Mr. Dunderbak's skimps on the Thousand Island and sauerkraut. The rye bread was bland and looked lifeless. The meat (corned beef and pastrami) was just decent. They really need to step up their game on their sandwiches. I had the Schnitzel Holstein; which wasn't bad. You get a large piece of shnitzel but the eggs on top of it were very small and only two. The schnitzel was good around the center but once you got to the edges it got dry and bland. The sides are where Mr. Dunderbak's excels. Tried a few different ones and all were really good.\n\nAs for the cleanliness mentioned above, halfway during out dinner we were surrounded by not only fruit flies but by regular flies. I'm assuming they came from the kitchen, bar, and restroom areas? But the worst was when I got one of Mr. Dunderbak's excellent imported German beers. After my 3rd sip, something just didn't smell right. Thought at first it was the beer but determined it was the glass itself. It reeked of dirty, gross dishwater. Double checked with my girlfriend and the waiter himself - both made the same squinty, wretched face of grossness when they smelled inside the glass. \nStuff like this happens, but for a German restaurant with good beer; unacceptable. Please Mr. Dunderbak's don't ruin good beer; wash your glasses better and cleaner each and every time. \n\nI do like the atmosphere at Mr. Dunderbak's. With the flags, seating set-up, beer bottles and boxes, and the guy playing the accordion in the middle of the restaurant in a gazeebo. Fun and festive ambience although; I wish their gifts and store merchandise was easier to look at. You have to have your butt a few inches from people eating when looking and paying for what they have.\n\nOverall - 3.75 stars","categories":["Beer","Wine & Spirits","Food","Pubs","German","American (Traditional)","Restaurants","Bars","Nightlife"]}

We ordered the slider sampler and a few different sides. The service was pretty good, fairly standard though our waitress was very nice.\n\nThe sides here are absolutely amazing! They are by far the best sides we have ever had. The three stars are for the sides. Unfortunately the meat was not good. It was incredibly dry and a decent amount of it had bones in it, which caught my by surprise since the meat was served on bread as sliders. It definitely was not a pleasant experience to take a bite and chomp down on a big bone. Apart from the bones the meat was very very dry and the flavor was just okay. I don't love BBQ sauce so I need moist meat that doesn't need to be drowned in sauce. This meat is so dry that the only way to eat it is to drown it in sauce. Even then it's not that good. My husband didn't even finish his sliders, which is highly abnormal. \n\nOverall we likely will not be back. We might come back to have some of the sides, but we would have to pass on the meat and that's kind of weird for a BBQ place...","categories":["Specialty Food","Event Planning & Services","American (New)","Restaurants","Barbeque","Caterers","Food","Beer Bar","Bars","American (Traditional)","Whiskey Bars","Nightlife"]}

{"stars":3,"text":"April 19, 2014 Friday - dinner 6:30 PM\n5 adults\n\nAtmosphere - 5 stars\nFood - 2 stars\nService - 3 stars \n\nBackground - Been to other locations, first time here.  We wanted to go to BJ's since they have a variety of food.  But as we drove up the ladies saw a line to get into the place and we still had a movie to hit.\n \nAtmosphere - What you expect from a Buffalo Wild Wings.  This one is larger than the one at the Summit.  The TV's are much better than that location too. \n\nFood\n  Drinks - They have probably somewhere between 20 to 30 taps, one was even a hard cider.  Since we sat in the bar I just walked over there as our waitress would just over whelm me if she could actually read them all off.  They do not have a published list, if have this many beers on tap provide a list somewhere, do not assume your staff can memorize it.  I got the Lagunitas IPA, excellent choice!\n\n  Appetizer - none.\n\n  My Main Course - I ordered 15 wings, with Buffalo sauce.  I would love to go hotter but my last experience I was warned not to by wife.  I take that warning very seriously.  What gets me is the steep price, almost $17, which is more than a dollar a wing for a tiny bit of meat.  I know I am getting old as I remember getting then for a nickel a piece.  You think a place that specializes in wings would be able to sell that at a more reasonable price.  Okay back to the wings themselves.  Average size and the sauce was lightly covering them.  I barely used one napkin.  I want a little more sauce; I don't need a lake under the wings but give me some.  The wings were not evenly coated; I do not even know how you manage that as you should be tossing them in a bowl all together.\n\n  Dessert - The waitress recommend the dessert nacho.  Wow not so nacho like, four burnt pieces of tortilla shells, burned like they were baked to long not fried.  Then four huge scopes of vanilla ice cream with some drizzled toppings.  The little cheese cake bites were okay.  Yeah it is a great group sharing dessert but bland and burning.  Four spoons for five people, really??\n\nService -Oh waitress was good, the kitchen not so much.  I told you about my wings.  One of the ladies in our party is a vegetarian.  So after she placed the order with the waitress, she ordered a salad meat free, I told the waitress that she was a vegetarian.  This was to emphasize the noteworthiness of this request.  So three of the orders came out, the waitress indicated there was some issues with the other two items and the manager will be out shortly.  The vegetarian salad was not so vegetarian with the meat added.  The manager brought it out the salad and indicated that they made a new one from scratch which always good.  My wife's meal can out even later as the manager indicated that they burnt the bread.  Really how hard is it to make a fancy grilled cheese sandwich.\n\nFuture - Only in a group setting and they want to come here.","categories":["American (Traditional)","Sports Bars","Chicken Wings","Nightlife","Restaurants","Bars"]}

{"stars":3,"text":"Where do I begin? I expected better service here, yet I received mediocre service. \n\nCons: \n1. I made reservations a month ago MAINLY to avoid waiting during the Christmas dinner; however, when I got to the front, the hostess didn't greet me nor did she listen to me when I told her I have reservations. \n\n2. I will admit that I was running late to my dinner, but I called ahead of time to notified the hostess that I'd be 15 - 20 mins late. She told me not to worry and noted that I would arrive a little late. Yet, when I officially arrived, she ignored the fact that I had reservations and called in.\n\n3. After that long cold wait, my guest & I were finally seated, but we were seated in a awkward spot in the building. I had plates clashing behind me and I had to frequently adjust my seat because \" I was in the way\".\n\n4. My waitress would disappear for long periods that I had to ask another waitress about receiving cheese bread. Mind you, we got that bread at the end of our meal. \n\n5. When I got home, OpenTable messaged me asking why I missed my dinner. I knew the hostess didn't check the system. \n\nPros: \n1. The meat cravers were probably the best & most delightful part of our experience here. They were very attentive and accommodating. They were phenomenal servers.\n\n\nWith that being said, I hope Fogo De Chao improves on their customer service.","categories":["Seafood","Steakhouses","Brazilian","Restaurants"]}

I'm not sold that this is true risotto, mixed and mixed vs rice that was tossed in a cheese sauce. The more I ate it, the more I questioned it -- BUT it was delicious enough for me to keep eating it right? Also the scallops were well seasoned, perfectly cooked.

I wouldn't change anything about this dish\n\nTostones -- 2 stars.. maybe 1. This was such an utter disappointment! tostones should be nice and crispy, salty, and lots of garlic! This was not crispy, almost no garlic, and no salt. I took a bite and discarded the rest :( \n\nMofungo -- awesome -- purely great. Brought me back to PR\n\nLa Loca drink -- good. Tasty, strong -- and at $9 I consider this fairly priced. \n\nService - 3.7 stars - started out strong. Our server was friendly, informative with the dishes and always on top of our drinks or empty water. The end of the meal however, took 10 minutes to come over with a dessert menu -- but we were looking for the check.\n\nAmbience -- love it.

A word to internet shoppers--even though the website states that the location is at the airport, you still have to take a shuttle to get there (so compare with other places that are further away, but may be more cost effective). If you are traveling with young child\/children (as we were), be aware that the wait may be substantial. When we arrived at the shuttle office, the lines were very long (probably 20 people waiting). I would encourage the office to consider perhaps hiring more staff to solve this problem. The staff available were very helpful, and were quite patient with the other customers, some of which were quite angry (and verbally expressed this anger) at having to wait about an hour to get a rental car. However, there were just not enough staff to efficiently serve the number of people waiting for a vehicle.

I understand that some people may not be able to pay, but a little more compassion in that way would be nicer than the hot\/cold treatment of payment before they truly care for your pet.

{"stars":3,"text":"When a comfort food restaurant is empty at 7:30 pm on a Sunday night, there is reason to think that perhaps that is saying something about the operation there. That was what we faced on a damp March night, but we were already inside, and as the old saying goes: \"What the hey?!\" \n\nTurns out that with the smoker out front, and a good chef in the kitchen, the food was pretty good.  Only problem was the slightly weird attitude of management that wanted our business, but at the same time had a series of rules they felt compelled to enforce while we ordered. First, they were closing in 30 minutes, which meant we had to order quickly.  We could eat inside while they cleaned up.  Second, our sandwiches came with fries, but any other side order was an extra buck. I wanted baked beans. Okay, bud, but fork over the sawback. Third, a medium burger wasn't possible because the health code required everything be grilled to well done.  What if I didn't like an over cooked burger?  They couldn't help me officially, but they did ask the chef to take it off the heat while still pink.  He said he would with a wink. \n\nUltimately, the brisket sandwich was quite tasty, with a nice rub making a flavorful bark.  It might have benefited from another hour in the smoker to make the beef more tender, but it was decent as it was.  My Firehouse Burger was very good, with nicely saut\u00e9ed\/grilled onions and peppers.  Half pound of ground beef was truly pink at its core, and proved a challenge to consume despite its excellent juicy profile.  The baked beans were also solidly flavorful, but could have used a few chunks of burnt ends or pulled pork in the mix to max out the texture and provide more twang. \n\nThe dining room was small, but comfortable, with Texas collectibles hanging for ceiling and wall. I would return to try the ribs or another burger, but not before I visited other nearby grillmasters to check out their goods.  I wasn't blown away by Fat Jack's, but neither was I repelled by their chuck wagon grub.","categories":["Food","Barbeque","Restaurants","Food Delivery Services","Southern","Chicken Wings","Sandwiches"]}

{"stars":3,"text":"Very busy during this visit - Valentine's Day 2021.  I told the hostesses that I was picking up an online order.  I was directed to what turned out to be a long line to order cheesecake.  I watched as a tall dark headed male at the other side of the counter start to take food orders.  He caught my eye and I said I was there to pickup an online order.  I was directed to come over, paid for and picked up my order that was over $100.  There was no thank you from this worker . . . REALLY!  Just gave me my food.  We went over to a table to check the order as I have had food left out in the past.  This again was the case.  One entree, Alfredo with chicken, was not there.  The woman at the counter went to the kitchen and got the food, apologized, saying it \"missed the bus.\"\n\nI returned to the hostess desk and asked to talk to the manager (blonde hair), first of all, asking about bread.  We had one section of sourdough for three entrees.  He explained that bread was complimentary but would be happy to get us more.  (I paid for a loaf of rye.)  Also told him of the ungratefulness of his male staff member, especially in a time when businesses are closing.  He explained that he was \"new.\" Again, REALLY!  Why do you as a grown man have to the trained to say \"Thank you!\"  The manager said he would talk to him.  Also addressed the minimum amount of chicken in the Alfredo.  There were very tiny pieces that had to be pointed out by the woman that got it from the kitchen.\n\nAlso, when ordering online, I tried to order the child's spaghetti and meatball.  Message online was that it was not available.  Asked the manager, about this. He explained that sometime they run out of items. HMMMM!  He looked on the computer and said they now had it and we would get that, bread and more chicken.  We did offer to pay for the child's meal.  He gave us these items for us free of charge.  Thank you! \n\nThe most irritating part of this visit was in ingratitude of the tall, dark headed worker.  Leaving out an entree was right behind. \n\nI often folks tell folks about the sign as you drive out of Cock of the Walk.  \"We had to be here but you had a choice!\"","categories":["Restaurants","Food","American (New)","Seafood","American (Traditional)","Desserts","Salad"]}

I generally enjoyed my meal and experience here along with having fun with the fact the building the restaurant is in has an interesting round shape with a side enclosed patio.  There are still some teething problems here as the bill didn't come out right as the prices in the system didn't accurately reflect the price posted on the menu for one of my visits and on another visit I was never given the lunch specials menu and I was upcharged for getting a different side item without being told there was going to be an upcharge.  They also have been having live music and they have happy hour specials every hour so this seems like it might be a fun spot to check out for some music and happy hour fun.  \n\nOverall this place is still very new to me so I look forward to learning more about it and so far other than the few hiccups mentioned I think this should turn out to be a nice spot to pass a good time with some good food.\n\nMy video review of The Gumbo Krewe is here:\n\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/Q2VTbhskMMg","categories":["Southern","Salad","Specialty Food","Cajun\/Creole","Pasta Shops","Food","Seafood","Restaurants","Sandwiches"]}

How pleasantly surprised was I when I dug into my dynamite maki roll (I started safe) and it tasted... fresh? Tasty, even? I did a little jig in my seat, a big smile plastered across my face! It's pretty good. My expectations for the sushi were admittedly low, and the spicy tuna wasn't so good as to inspire complete confidence in the quality and freshness of the fish, but it was more than acceptable. \n\nThe miso soup was, as other reviewers have mentioned, perfectly familiar and delicious, tasting exactly as it should. Now, the beef teriyaki and tonkatsu (deep fried pork) are really something to get excited about, well made and flavorful, generous portions with delicious accompaniments and lots of layering in the sauces. I also really like the tofu salad even if it falls a little on the boring side-- it's just a couple pieces of soft tofu on lettuce, but it comes with a really yummy mushroom-y dressing that leaves a lasting impression. \n\nI only saw it for a bit as I ordered take-out, but the interior wasn't as much to my taste as other reviewers. It's pretty dark, and to me, the waterfall and Japanese screens border on the cheesy.

If you're in the mood for a quick latin bite and you happen to be in the area, why not? \n\nTried a little bit of everything, from the white rice and beans with fried chicken to the cuban sandwich, to the mofongo with bistec and the shrimp coconut. \n\nI enjoyed the rice and red beans, the fried chicken was so so, thought the cuban was a bit on the salty side, the mofongo\/bistec was ok at best, the beef was a cheap cut and wasn't cooked to my liking, would've also preferred my onions caramelized. The coconut shrimp was probably my favorite dish, but again nothing to rave about. \n\nService was great, our waitress was very attentive and brought the food out in timely fashion. She also offered a refill to go which I though was nice. \n\nAll in all, just ok for me. I grew up eating Dominican food which is similar to Puerto Rican so it could just be my taste buds. \n\nThe fact that you can also find better choices at affordable prices out in the latin neighborhoods of Tampa, is reason enough for me to not go out of my way.","categories":["Spanish","Restaurants","Caribbean","Cuban","Puerto Rican"]}

They weren't fall of the bone tender but they were edible. My 2 sides were mac and cheese and baked beans. The portions of the sides was quite small in comparison to the ratio of meat (which was a decent amount).  The mac was also kinda bland; they used penne pasta with egg and petmilk, topped with kraft singles. Not a lot of salt. The baked beans (they called them \"beans Alexander\") were extremely sweet, way too sweet and heavily seasoned with cinnamon and ketchup. The sweet potato pie was just ok.

This is definitely not a 4 or 5-star hotel but they try by having great customer service. The gentlemen at the front desk were nice and very welcoming had a great conversation with them. When checking out the girl at the front desk was a bit rude which shocked a bit but It didn't let it ruin my day. Parking at the hotel is $30 per night. They have heated pool too.\n\nCons: if you're looking for a place to just sleep and close to a lot of places this is it. It is loud the walls are thin and you can hear everything from going to the restroom to your next door neighbors. I came back at 11 to sleep and could hear my neighbors next room. I was to tired to cared and it didn't bother me I slept just fine. I would stay here again. Also, do not buy water or drinks from this place it's expensive I spend $15 on one can of beer and their waters are $6.

Finally got our drinks ordered and ordered some boudin balls($8.00). The drinks were good although my cosmo was barely 3\/4 filled and for $9 at least fill the martini glass. The  balls came out and they were quite good. really good.\n\nWe ordered another round of drinks(bloody mary $7.50 and st germain cocktail $9) and the bartender(Melanie) took our menus away. without asking if we were going to order anything else, which we had intention on. Drinks were deposited quickly and that's the last we saw of her. Although she was right behind the bar and could see us giving her the eye since we were only 6 feet away no effort was made on her part whatsoever.\n\nAt that point, fellow Yelper P.E.M. (who is friends with the owners and the only reason I decided to try the place after their unfortunate health code violation history, closed april 2014 for live roaches, which he assured me has been cleared up) was fed up and ready to leave. Since we had a few cocktails I nixed that idea and said let's just go sit at the bar. \"If you cant get service to come to  you, go to them\" grrrr\n\nAfter that, since the bartender didn't have to move more then 3 feet service was good. He ordered the fried oyster po boy ($14) and I ordered the shrimp po boy ($12) with romoulade instead of the basic mayo it comes with (that gets a star deduction in itself) His was good, not my thing, but I can see why he  liked it. Mine, well, tasted rank. I don't know if it was the shrimp or the sauce or the combo of, but it was bad. About 1\/4 way through I realized if I ate this I'd pay for it so I scraped the shrimp and sauce off and had a tomato and lettuce sandwich. (I would of sent it back and complained but since he is friends with the owners I tried to play nice) \n\nThey were lucky to get 3 stars as the atmosphere was cute, the drinks were good, and the boudin balls were delish.

Chili's is literally five minutes from where we live,  so what the heck.  \n\nWe get there and it's about a ten minute wait for a table. I took a glance at the bar but it was packed so table it is.  This Friday evening's crowd consisted of teens on first dates, folks grabbing drinks and families taking their kids to dinner.  \n\nWhile sitting there, we noticed five or six servers standing around, talking and paying no attention to the crowd forming at the hostess stand and through the door.  Another server walks over to chat with someone's dessert in hand.  Yikes.  \n\nAnyway,  we were sat at a two top which was way too small.  Kind of  like a children's table. I think I mistakenly kicked my guy three or four times during our lackluster meal.  So,  we're talking and talking... And talking.. Then I realize ten minutes had passed us by.  At this point, I'm getting annoyed and about to turn into some evil creature because I'm starving.  I tell Luis to make up his mind now so once the server arrives from the Land of Nowhere, USA... We'll be ready.  She finally arrived and takes our order.  \n\nHe gets the classic burger and I order the Cajun chicken pasta, both part of their 2 for $20 deal, along with a stack of onion rings for an appetizer.

You might have guessed it, the manager was  ******* and after reading other reviews tonight we aren't the only ones who have seen her at her \"finest\". (Kath S. and James M. wrote about  *******'s behavior and I'm certain she's the one John G. has a problem with as well. James' and John's reviews are hidden in the filtered area and are a must read.) Anyway, everyone was floored by her behavior and felt so bad for the teen  ******* had targeted. We could see it in the faces of the people around us as well. It seemed no matter what the girl did, it was wrong and  ******* would yell at her and called her names like 'stupid'.  ******* didn't care who heard. There is never a reason to embarrass anyone, especially in front of about 5 other groups of people trying to enjoy their time there. The girl looked astounded, humiliated, and close to tears. We were appalled! \n\nA group by us complained about  *******'s actions to their server and asked to speak with a different manager. That manager offered them a free meal because of it. Yet no further action seemed to have worked because as we left she still was treating her staff with utter disrespect. \n\nMy family has supported LIttle Anthony's for many years and we have seen aggression from  ******* often. Yet this event that took place today makes us not want to come back ever again to witness this abusive behavior. I'm surprised an employee hasn't sued Little Anthony's for harassment by the way they are being treated by  *******. I guess that day will come.\n\nI've never seen the need to write a review in the past, but I decided that I needed to warn other families to look elsewhere to take the kids just as we will do now, since speaking with the head manager didn't accomplish anything. I will NEVER take my family back to Little Anthony's again until I know  ******* is gone for good! \n\n(I'm giving stars in hopes that this review remains on the main page and not in the filtered section.)","categories":["Restaurants","Diners","American (Traditional)"]}

Drunken noodle - this was a mediocre dish with a hint of spice. That's about it...\n3. Eggplant basil beef stir fry - the component of the basil and chili seemed to be missing. It lacked flavor.\n4.

We were assures that we would have a 1st floor, 2 queen bed room. When we arrived however we had been \"upgraded\" to a 2nd floor room with 2 queens and a sleeper sofa.

{"stars":3,"text":"The GOOD:\nMy wife and I have experienced this place twice (one good, one bad experience). We visited once on a Monday, then had family in town and decided to visit again that same week on Friday. Our first experience was great! Second one... after talking them up and bringing guests along was not cool...\n\nFirst visit we sat outside which was really nice, there was a great breeze, great atmosphere, plenty of shade, plenty of people watching to enjoy, fast service (I wish I remember our server's name so I could recommend him!), excellent service, all the food came out together and exactly as we ordered it, the drinks we ordered were delicious, etc. It was an overall fantastic experience!!\n\nThey have an attached bakery that produces some fantastic croissants (especially the chocolate ones). I would return here to the bakery again, but we don't eat bread\/sugar all that often and honestly would skip the restaurant for other places along Beach Dr. You'll understand why below...\n\nThey have valet service available, but we have never had issues parking right in front at the available metered parking! It's sometimes nice to even park on the next street over (by the water) and walk along\/through the park to the restaurant.\n\nTHE BAD:\nSecond visit we dragged some family and friends with us... it was a little hot outside so we opted to sit indoors. First, we were seated at two random tables (they weren't pushed together for us) where we had to push the tables together ourselves and had to take a chair from a third table due to lack of seating... We all sat and chatted\/laughed\/caught up\/etc before someone said, wait has anyone seen a waiter... we all realized nobody had stopped by to take drink orders or even say hi! There were 4 hosts\/hostesses standing by the door and no waiters... we also started looking around and the tables on either side of us were covered in dirty plates\/glasses\/etc. as if there was no busser... strange... anyway we finally saw our waiter after a good 15-20 minutes of sitting there. She said, \"hey guys, I'll be right back!\" ...awesome... She eventually came back and asked if we were all ready to order... so we ordered drinks and food all at once and didn't see her again until after the meal when she brought us our check. We were one of 2 tables seated inside, and she wasn't serving any tables outside as they had multiple servers helping the outside tables. We literally had no idea what she was doing. Anyway, the expo was nice, the random guy who brought us our drinks was also nice, and the hostess who I had to ask for drink refills from was also nice, but I don't know what happened to our waiter... Had I been leaving the tip, she wouldn't have received much, but the person who did left 20% which was far too much for the level of service we received... this was one of the few times the whole table agreed that the waiter deserved less than 10% (we honestly considered writing \"for the hostess and expo ONLY\" on the check, or handing those two cash directly...)\n\nTHE STRANGE:\nAnd what is up with that bathroom situation!? The men's bathroom had only one stand-up urinal and no regular toilet!! I have never seen this before, even in little dive restaurants on the beach in the Caribbean, they have toilets... even in remote towns of Guatemala, they have toilets... but in our back yard, on the water, in downtown, at a slightly upscale breakfast restaurant... NO TOILET IN THE MEN'S ROOM!?!? WTF? *See edit below*\n\nTHE EDIT:\nAfter seeing the business's response I ventured back into this business while visiting another restaurant nearby to check out the bathroom... They do have a stall\/toilet, however on my previous visit there was a ladder\/tool box\/equipment leaning against that door where the stall is so I thought that was a maintenance room and not a toilet. Good to know they do have a proper bathroom, but a \"out of order\" sign would have been nice if it were undergoing maintenance. *Edited March 2018*","categories":["Brasseries","French","American (New)","Restaurants"]}

I went for their much-hyped Sunday Supper--a fixed course menu for $35\/pp plus tip and tax.  The price is fair for the amount of food that you receive, but definitely not the quality.  We began with a lentil soup that I thought was underseasoned and their usual dinner rolls.  This was followed by a flavorless (and kind of puny) beet dish and a boring salad of bitter greens and not much else.\n\nFor the entree, you have a choice of fried chicken or herb-roasted chicken.  Our waitress recommended we get the fried.  It was ok.  There was a high crispy skin to actual chicken ratio and between the two of us, we got two drumsticks and three legs--really, no chicken breast?!?  The mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese were the highlight of the meal for me--they were both made of creamy deliciousness and were definitely worth the calories!  My fiance loved their haricot verts, although I thought brussel sprouts would have been a better accompaniment.  And the pickled carrots were unremarkable.\n\nDessert was an apple-rhubarb cobbler with cinnamon ice cream that was very good--although I would have loved an extra scoop of ice cream :-)  All in all, I would have rather had fewer courses and that each one was done better.\n\nBottom line: I'm not sorry I went, but I will savor my Sunday supper elsewhere from now on.","categories":["Burgers","American (New)","American (Traditional)","Restaurants"]}

The bar staff was really friendly even though they were working like dogs! People were getting a bit bitchy about the wait, but hello.. you saw the line. \n\nExcitement for the evening came when some girls came out of the restroom to inform the bar staff that a chick was passed out in there. Turns out it was an employee who was in celebrating her birthday with friends. Nice way to impress the boss! We have all been there, but hopefully not where we work! \n\nDo I like PF Chang? Sure.

{"stars":3,"text":"3-Stars and here is why.  Our neighbors invited us to join them for dinner tonight at the Green Lemon.  It was our first time dining at the restaurant.  One of the greatest things about dining out with friends is the conversations over what you hope will be great food.  Hold that thought.\n\nSo we arrived around 6:30 pm and we were told that it would be an hour wait.  They were correct, we were seated around 7:45 pm, a little over an hour.  Is it worth waiting that long for a meal?  I suppose really that it depends on a number of factors.  Lets get back to the conversation part of things.\n\nThe place is loud.  No, not just loud, painfully loud.  It was hard to understand the server without her bending down to speak with us, and once I left the restaurant my ears were ringing and I am not exaggerating. \n\nLets talk about the food for a moment.  We were seated at a relatively small table for four people and spent a bit of time juggling plates and glasses, until they were picked up by a bus person or the server.  Thankfully, the empties did not stay on the table too long.  We ordered the trio of salsa, guac and queso to start.  Nothing really special flavor wise, but the ingredients are fresh.  The tortilla chips are fresh as well and crispy.  For dinner, I ordered the Trio of tacos with a side of rice and beans.  I had the carnitas, carne enchilada and ancho chicken on soft corn tortillas.  The presentation is very nice and each of the tacos...though a bit on the cold side, were very very tasty.  I loved the portions.  The protein's were cooked perfectly and the ingredients very fresh.  The spicier of the dishes hit all of the right notes with a nice kick.  The rice and beans- eh...they're rice and beans, a side, a lonely addition to the tacos and maybe enough for 4 bites?\n\nLets get back to the noise.  First, it was a Friday I will give them that.  The restaurant is clearly popular with the millennial crowd, and the place was PACKED WALL TO WALL.  All of that said, LOUD.  I am only 47 and I still have a lot of fun in me and like to have a good time like anyone.  But the music, and the noise of the patrons does not an evening out with friends wanting to enjoy conversation make.  Its not that we won't return, but most likely not for dinner. I will try the lunch service at some point because I enjoyed the food, but never on a weekend.\n\nMy ears are still ringing a bit and I have been home for about an hour as I write this.  Not sure what they could do to change this, but ya know, the owners probably give two flips what I think because the loud and obnoxious folks that fill the place, pay the bills.  \n\nAgain, the food is great, but the atmosphere- if you don't like eating your food and not being able to hear your dining mates unless of course you scream at one another..be thoughtful in your choice of Green Lemon on a weekend night.","categories":["Food","Tapas Bars","Gluten-Free","Tacos","Restaurants","Latin American","Tapas\/Small Plates","Breakfast & Brunch","Bars","Mexican","Event Planning & Services","Caterers","Nightlife"]}

I would come home from a 40 mile bike ride, shower, then walk over exhausted, and consume some cheap mexican. It was never crowded, and had the feel of a funky, off the beaten path kind of place. Though not \"truly mexican\", it was at least \"light and fresh\".. it didn't fill you up and load you down like huge burritos covered in cheese.\n\nThe owners were always there, preparing the food. They were nice, and remembered your face enough so that they could anticipate any little deviations you habitually had... such as no lettuce on the enchilada, or whatever the hell it was I ordered. It's such a nice thing when you aren't forced to explain your gastronomic idiosyncrasies to the waiter every time you order. It takes energy, and you begin to feel as if you're just a whiny complainer who can't take what is offered.\n\nBut like all really good things in this world, it outgrew it's perfection and took the predictable step of moving to a new location in order to replicate it's formula to a vast downtown crew of lunchtime office workers.\n\nI followed it there. Goodbye quirky tree-lined charm of 4th street.. hello vast impersonal canyon of JFK Blvd. Things would never be the same. Well, the food is the same. But the place is only really open for lunch. No more late evening food. When you close at 4pm, you just can't be cool anymore. \n\nThe final straw was when I noticed that the guy who owns the place was wearing a Rolex watch. I remarked... \"Whoa, a rolex\". To which he replied, \"Hey, I earned that\". Indeed he had. He and his wife worked their asses off, and made the right strategic moves to rake in that lunchtime money. But in so doing, the snatched from me one of the pure places of downtrodden joy available in this world. Unforgivable. \n\nWhen I pass along 4th street now, I have to focus to remember which of the storefronts used to house Hot Tamales \"back in the day\".  Such things are inevitable.

I definitely was not going to pay for a second one.\n\nThe waitress later in came back and and said she would give me another one for free because she felt bad because she hadnt said anything to me when she placed it down therefore I didnt know it was there. \n\nEverything was fun and welcoming other than that moment. \n\nThat was very nice of her. However, this being a custom of this establishment makes me wary of getting anything if I were to return. \n\nI work in a Starbucks and if someone drops a drink, no matter how or why, I remake it for free. At restaurants if you drop your food or drink it's remade for free. Or just taken off the check.\n\nKnowing that if I were to spill my drink by accident here I would have to pay for that spilled drink and, if im thirsty, a new one is ridiculous and to me poor customer service.","categories":["Themed Cafes","Eatertainment","Bars","Nightlife","Restaurants","Arts & Entertainment","Cafes","Pubs"]}
{"stars":3,"text":"Bottom line:  Good food, fair price, but unforgivably variable service times.\n\nWe decided to go here for a friend's birthday lunch since they were really fast last time and many of us are hourly.  Like last time, we called in advance to let them know we were coming.  They even accommodated the 2 extra, unexpected people very well.  However, it took 30 minutes for us to get our food, which is odd because I saw three people in the kitchen and there weren't that many tables.  We sat down and ordered by 12:15 and at 12:50 one of our party was still waiting for her food.  We asked for separate checks, but our server said one check would be easier.  Then, after figuring out everyone's portion of the bill and trying to pay it with cash and credit cards, the server said it was too confusing and went back to give us separate checks.  I wouldn't have minded either way, but it would have been better if she'd picked one (separate or one check) and stuck with it; that way we wouldn't have wasted the time pooling our money for the single check.  The food was good, the portions were great, but the service was rather disappointing.  I may come again if I have more time, but I will definitely think twice about ever eating lunch on a workday here again.","categories":["Burgers","American (New)","Diners","Breakfast & Brunch","Fish & Chips","Restaurants"]}

About 6 taps with mid priced beer ($5-6), though the extra dollar for a hand pump seems a bit ridiculous.\n\nIf I had to rate Watkins solely on the food, it would get  2 stars.  Their menu seems to be more about \"cool\" factor rather than good food. First of all, being known for game meat, I expected a bit more than boar, rabbit, and ostrich.  Where was the kangaroo and lion? After actually trying the food though, I'm glad they had a boring menu.  What is the point of all these unusual meats unless it's executed properly?  My friend ordered venison nachos and for $9 I expected a lot more.  There were a few bare nachos on the plate with some unflavored meat and tomatoes sprinkled on top.  I ordered the boar sandwich and it was awful.  The boar was completely unflavored (not even any salt!).  It was just some meat thrown into a bun with some broccoli rabe on top.  The only decent thing were the fries (and really, how hard is it to make fries).  I can get better game meat at Fuddruckers (seriously, the Ostrich and Bison burgers are pretty good there).  I was very interested in trying different game meats, but their chef needs to learn how to cook regular food first.\n\nI ended up spending a lot more money than I wanted to (especially on food), so I highly doubt I'll be back.","categories":["Sandwiches","Burgers","Restaurants","Pets","Bars","Nightlife","Vegan","Pubs","Gastropubs"]}

{"stars":3,"text":"I recently brought my vehicle to ClearView to have all of the windows tinted, as well as their \"UV Kit\" for the windshield. Being a former window film installer myself, I am hesitant to pay someone for work I can do myself. However, I brought my vehicle to these guys because they install SunTek film, which is some of the best stuff on the market and I no longer have the means to order SunTek film. Their installer, Alex, did a great job on all the windows and I was very pleased with his work. He informed me that he most likely would not be able to do my UV kit because the rearview mirror bracket on my particular vehicle is very tricky and he didn't want to risk breaking the windshield. I totally understood and would have done the same thing myself. He said we would need to reschedule that portion of the work for a time when their lead installer was working. I agreed and was on my way. The following business day, I called to schedule that time and the lady who answered the phone said that this particular installer was out in the field and to check back the next day. I did that, and continued to be pushed back. After a whole week of trying to schedule work I had already paid for, I kept getting denied. Finally, I went into their store and asked for my money back on that portion of the installation. One of the people came out of the office with a new invoice saying the refund amount would be $75, when $125 is what I had prepaid for the UV kit and windshield strip. When I presented the original invoice, they got very defensive and said \"we never charge $125 for those. We gave you a discount.\" Which simply wasn't true. The math didn't add up and they were trying to keep an additional $50 in their pocket. When I questioned that, another guy in the office said \"Just give him the money back, he's not worth the argument.\" \n\nSo, after all this, why the 3 star review instead of 1 star? Well the first part of my experience here was actually quite good. Scheduling the appointment was easy and convenient, the receptionist was pleasant, and the installation was very clean with only minor defects. It wasn't until they tried to swindle me when everything became bad. It was almost dealing with two completely different companies. I will not be using this particular company again in the future, and I personally feel that Alex should be working for a company where his skills can be backed by a better business.","categories":["Windshield Installation & Repair","Auto Glass Services","Home Window Tinting","Automotive","Home Services"]}

Specialty cookies I could maybe understand although even with those I would think you would have had a larger amount available especially in a high traffic area, but even the regular cookies weren't really available. The worker there that evening was pleasant enough though. He just seemed to be working alone and maybe a bit stressed so who knows if they were shorthanded.

Having worked in an Italian kitchen, I feel the sauces are under seasoned.  The Alfredo sauce is extremely thick with the texture of canned Alfredo. I'm not sure if they over-reduce it or what goes wrong, but it is consistently bland and too thick. The tomato sauces are thin and have no flavors of basil or oregano that you would expect.  For appetizers, we usually get calamari and bruschetta. I enjoy the calamari and again, it is a large portion for the price, but it definitely needs the lemon to give the breading any flavor. The bruschetta is lacking acidity and overall just tastes like overripe tomatoes in olive oil. Large portions at affordable prices, but subpar food quality.","categories":["Desserts","Event Planning & Services","Sandwiches","Restaurants","Food","Italian","Venues & Event Spaces"]}

{"stars":3,"text":"1. Hattie B's will never be a substitute for Prince's.\n2. Hattie B's still has good hot chicken.\n3. Really, if you stand in line you must not have discovered the Internet. Takeout, duh. There are parks very close to both Nashville locations. Order online and take it to a park or home or eat in your car. There is no atmosphere at either location, so why bother to wait to eat in?\n4. The main problem with Hattie B's is consistency. See below.\n\nI have both eaten in and ordered takeout from Hattie B's. Mostly takeout the last couple years. I always order the same thing: large dark, shut the cluck up, mac and cheese, and southern greens. Two extra pickle cups. The pickle cups are clutch with hot chicken. I also order them at Prince's. I have tried every side at HB's, but I love greens and I love mac. The mac here is often under seasoned, but it is better than the other choices. The greens are great. The problem I have is that shut the click up is sometimes perfectly burningly hot, and sometimes, like today, it is blah. Hot, but really not what I ordered since my receipt clearly states \"shut the cluck up,\" not merely \"hot.\" I guess it depends on who is making the chicken that day. When you can get real STCU, the spice is awesome. Days like today, meh. Another inconsistency - you may get a full dish of your side items, or you may get less than half the dish filled. Lastly, ordering extra pickle cups does not mean I don't want or need the pickles that ordinarily come on the chicken itself. Sometimes the people working the front are on point, but sometimes they are clueless or absent, or pack wet items like the greens so they spill inside your to go bag. If the portions, employees, and spice level were more consistent I would give HB's another star, but it really isn't the best experience or quality. It suffices in a pinch.","categories":["American (Traditional)","Chicken Shop","Southern","Restaurants","Chicken Wings","American (New)","Soul Food"]}

{"stars":3,"text":"Everyone has been talking about House of Cards for months now. A trendy new restaurant opening at the bottom of a museum? Yes please, sign me up. \n\nFor reservations, they use OpenTable. You can't book more than 2 weeks in advance. Looking at the Friday night reservations coming up, it was pretty clear booking was going to be a race to get the best times. Fast forward a few days later, I set the alarm on my phone for 11:59pm on Thursday hoping to be able to book a normal dinner time at 6:30. Of course, I woke up and told my alarm to F off, and ended up waking up the next morning to find that my much desired 6:30 reservations were taken. 5:30 was the only time that made sense for us.\n\nEven though we are local, we were in the midst of a Staycation during Memorial Weekend, and had a room at the brand new Bobby Hotel downtown. The whole time we were walking to the restaurant, my husband was complaining that he bet this place didn't \"really\" have a dress code, and was thinking he overdressed. He was of course, wrong. We went downstairs through the Cash museum, and found everyone dressed to a T. I love that they enforce the dress code so strictly. They are one of the few places in the area that do. I also love that they don't allow photos. I don't think it ever said no cell phones, but either way everyone had theirs put away for the entire night.  \n\nOnce seated, we ordered a round of drinks. I already had a tequila drink at the Rooftop bar at the hotel so to avoid punishing my body in the morning, I stuck to tequila. I ordered the Quick Escape ($17) which has Absinthe, Corralejo Tequila, Aloe Vera, Pineapple, and coconut.  I couldn't tell you what my husband ordered, but I will say that both of our drinks were amazing. They were definitely the star of the show that night. \n\nAfter ordering drinks from our server (Ian), we watched the magician perform for maybe 20-30 minutes before being called back to our table. Right away we noticed that our entrees were served before our appetizer. We mentioned it to the server. He looked at us confused and semi embarrassed, a female (I'm assuming who was his boss) was behind us, so I said oh no worries, maybe we \"thought\" we ordered it... but just forgot too. In all reality, my husband very clearly ordered mussels. When he brought them to us (boss disappeared) he announced that I was right- of course we didn't order them, but here he had them anyway... like he was doing us some kind of favor. False buddy, I was just trying to cover for you so that you didn't look like a jack-ass in front of your boss. Maybe if you can't remember an order, you should try writing it down... or perhaps finding a new profession, one that doesn't require you to have any people skills. If we are going to be paying $200 for a dinner for 2, I expect the service to reflect that. I'm not joking when I say I have had better service at Dennys (in fact now that I think about it, I've actually never had a bad service experience at Dennys, those folks work hard for their money).\n\nOkay- now to the food. Regardless of the appetizer mix up, The Steamed Black Mussels ($20) we ordered were DELICIOUS. Like, holy smokes delicious. Like I've mentioned before, I've seen some not so great reviews about House of Cards, and came in with expectation that we were paying for the experience, not the food. I ordered the sea bass ($36) which wasn't on the menu, but was announced as a special when we sat down. It was also amazing. Definitely worth the price tag. The side of Brussels sprouts ($13) we ordered were pretty tasty. My husbands burger ($20) (yeah, what kind of loser orders a burger in a suit!?) was incredible. Half way through our meal, our waiter came to us and asked us if we were finished, literally while my husband was shoving a bite in his mouth. No of course we aren't finished dude. That's why both of our mouths and plates our still full. At first I thought maybe it's cause the main event magic show was going to begin, but that was a lie. 15 minutes later when we were done with our food, we were still able to sit in the front row at the magic show. \n\nIf we are being completely honest here, the magic didn't impress me. We tried to go in with an open mind, but it was hard not to figure out the majority of the tricks.  \n\nCool experience. Cool location. Good food. Terrible service. \nWould not return.","categories":["American (Traditional)","Restaurants","Seafood","Steakhouses"]}

{"stars":3,"text":"I'm not sure if I would go back to this place again.  First of all, a group of 9 of us went on a Monday night and it was not busy at all.  They seated us at a table upstairs by a bunch of vents that were blowing cold air. IT WAS FREEZING. We asked to move after asking for them to turn it off only for it to turn back on again.  We moved to a table downstairs. At this point, we were the only table in there other than some people sitting at the bar.  I had to ask for a water 3 times before I ever got it.  The beer wall was cool but there were no beers I liked. They were all hoppy or fruity. I'm more of a cream ale drinker.  I decided to order a boozy milkshake instead. My cookie milkshake was just OK.  Our food took FOREVER even though we were like the only ones in there.  The staff kept apologizing that they were short staffed.  I get that that happens sometimes but we were the only ones in there!  The food was pretty good but came out somewhat cold. To top it all off, I think our server was on drugs. He was not all there and seemed very scatter brained.","categories":["Nightlife","Sandwiches","Bars","Desserts","Food","Restaurants","Beer Bar","Cocktail Bars","American (Traditional)","Salad"]}

For my girlfriends and I this hotel had everything we needed for a long weekend in NOLA. The location is amazing for nightlife, though obviously that means a bit of noise if you're on a low floor or streetside. We had a top floor room on the pool courtyard and didn't have any trouble with noise. The room was clean and decently furnished, though the pillows were a bit confusing--the two firm and two soft pillows are stacked together, so make sure you trade one with your bedmate if you'd like one of each. The major drawback is the lack of gym and limited in-room toiletries and dining options. If you'd like those amenities I'd go elsewhere, but for our group, the hotel was fine for our purposes.","categories":["Hotels","Event Planning & Services","Hotels & Travel","Venues & Event Spaces","Resorts"]}

We were kinda tipsy and hungry after a delayed delta flight... we had drinks before food. So we stopped at the first restaurant we saw, and this was it. The wait time was around 30-45 mins. It was a busy Friday on bourbon, so that was to be expected. Once we got seated, the waitress came pretty quickly. \n\nWe ordered 3 hurricanes (great, strong and perfect to keep our buzz going) i love red beans and rice, and that's all i craved ever since touching down in Nola. Where else do you have such an amazing meal? Lol. So i ordered red beans and rice, which came with a smoked sausage, and i added on fried chicken tenders for an extra $5 i believe. We also got charbroiled oysters, which my sister enjoyed. She loved them, and they came with charred French bread which is always a win. They also ordered shrimp and grits, which came with a fried green tomato. \n\nThe red beans and rice was good. I had no complaints. It was exactly what i needed to help offset the alcohol. They complained that the grits were a little watery at this establishment, but not bad. Not creamy or anything. Bug watery, and they enjoyed the shrimp. I would give this place 3.5 stars.

As much as we spend there, it's a shame that the bread is no longer complimentary nor is it as tasty.

I assumed it was just another sushi joint - wrong!\nSo I finally dined here a few weeks ago and was pleased to discover various vegan items.  It's a bit tapas style, so I wouldn't come here expecting a ginormous meal.  My evening's muchies are viewable in the \"photos.\".  Nothing super duper unique as far as the vegetarian options are concerned, but the non-veg options are quite intriguing and adventurous. \nThe vegetable gyozas were perfectly pan-fried, but filled with your basic ho hum veggie fillers.  I've had a lifetime of superior gyozas so I wasn't that wowed, but they're pretty okay.\nThe grilled shittake mushrooms were great, but just that - grilled mushrooms with a light sprinkling of salt.  Again, not wowed, but quite palatable. \nThe lotus chips, now they were quite a sight to behind - crispy holey discs.   Sorry to disappoint but they pretty much tasted like regular ole fried potato chips.  \nAs for the onigiri, quite interesting!  Basically consists of seaweed wrapped rice bundles filled with salted plums and appeals to that those umami tastebuds that I assume most people never really stimulate at all.  I really rather liked these - very distinct from anything I've ever tried. \nI also had the um, alcohol, that was not sake (my memory sucks).  It's supposedly similar to vodka and I had the green tea and sweet yam (I think?  Hah!).  They were both very mild and very sippable and drinkable, way more than regular vodka for sure (although bless vodka, I love it dearly).  \nOverall this place was just average to me.  It feel it was a tad bit pricey for what it was, but I'm sure if I was more of a, say omnivore, the experience would've been far more exciting in terms of trying unique dishes and flavors.  \nI rather eat my favorite standby of vegetable and avocado sushi rolls instead of this any day, sorry to say!","categories":["Tapas Bars","Bars","Restaurants","Nightlife","Japanese"]}

My real beef with Empire is their delivery procedure to hotels. \n\nI stayed at the Hyatt Regency, a 900+ room hotel a short drive from Empire. Being a lazy traveler for the night sounded great, and pizza was ordered. The disappointment lies in the fact that rather than bring the pizza to your room, they call you ahead of time and have you meet them in the lobby. If I wanted to put on respectable pants and shoes I would've gone out to eat. Then, of course, despite my commute to the elevator (literally 100+ steps) and the ensuing 9-story descent I still beat the driver to the meet-up spot by a few minutes. In an effort to avoid any opportunity to be a provider of great service, our driver didn't even offer napkins (or paper plates), which I'd say is fairly standard when delivering to people that are at a hotel.\n\nIn hindsight, I should've just gone out to Pi Pizzeria.","categories":["Restaurants","Pizza","Delis"]}

It wasn't the squirrelly meat you get at your average Subway. The bread was toasted and soft. The parmesan cheese was somewhat tasteless, and was probably very cheap.

{"stars":3,"text":"I had heard from several friends that the pizza here was legendary. Needing a night out of the house, I took my family of five here for dinner. When we walked in on a Saturday night, the place was absolutely packed to the gills. I wasn't sure where to stand to wait for a table, so two open tables were snagged by other families before I could get us sat down. We did manage to find a table fairly quickly after that; and there were only a few others waiting for a table while we were eating. Despite the crush of business that night, the wait staff was very friendly and attentive, keeping an upbeat and fun attitude. I definitely can agree with other reviewers that the service here is very good.\nThe atmosphere is like a bar, I would say - packed in wooden tables, floors and chairs, with a few booths seating 4 tucked in on the sides. Waitresses have to maneuver deftly between the crowded room to bring your drinks and food. The noise level wasn't too loud, though.\nWe ordered breadsticks as an appetizer and they were good. I ordered the kids a small pizza with cheese and black olives and then went for the meat lovers' pizza for myself and the wife. It lived up to the legend in being about 2\" thick with slices of bacon and hunks of ham as well as the normal sausage and pepperoni. I ordered the largest size and was eating leftovers for the rest of the week. I could only eat two pieces at dinner. \nI would say the pizza was good - nothing gourmet or specifically unique  other than the heaping amount of toppings. I didn't taste much in the way of herbs or spices or garlic. The crust was average, thin and kind of crisp; reminded me of Chuck E Cheese' pizza. The ingredients were fresh and the pizza was served piping hot.\nThe drink and beer list is huge, if you're in the mood for a beer with your pizza.\nI would come back sometime with family, but would try to come earlier in the evening so the kids aren't starving.","categories":["American (Traditional)","Pizza","Restaurants"]}
{"stars":3,"text":"My husband and I visited the Four Seasons Cielo for a dinner date. We were excited to give this AAA Five Diamond Hotel\/AAA Four Diamond restaurant a try! The hotel has a modern\/minimalist atmosphere. The view of downtown STL from the restaurant and patio is fabulous! This is a great place to get dressed up for drinks on the outdoor patio before a night on the town. Outside, the variety of seating--everything from hi\/low tops and sofas helps to create a hip, lounge feel. Fire pits\/heaters will keep you warm in the colder months.\n\nWe ordered from the $35.00 four course tasting menu. We loved the delectable bruschetta. The house cured pork belly had incredible flavor and was a unique dish. The veal and truffle essence ravioli was good, but not outstanding. My husband thought the petite steak was fine. It had good flavor, but was overcooked and lacking in texture and quality. The mascarpone in the tiramisu was dreamy and delicious. \n\nHaving had our wedding at the Four Seasons Resort in Arizona, we are huge fans of the FS attentive, friendly, personable service, and phenomenal setting, accommodations, and food. We have been to several Four Seasons and have always been beyond pleased with the extraordinary, memorable 'only in a dream' experience. \n\nOf all the FS we have been to, I would say this one is the least luxurious and most laid back in terms of service and decor. While the service is friendly, it is not top-notch\/lack of attention to detail and the caliber of food is not comparable to other FS hotels. For example, they did not have a flavor of ice cream my husband ordered and instead, the server brought out a different flavor without asking him if he preferred to try something else. The crunchy stuffed olives came out nearly burnt. Usually a kitchen mishap like this would never make it to the table at a Four Seasons. \n\nThe idea of $35 tasting menu is good, but not when quality is sacrificed.  The food and service was decent, but due to not living up to the bar of excellence we expect from The Four Seasons we give Cielo a 3\/5. Needless to say, we are loyal supporters of the FS hotels and will come back to give this place a second chance.","categories":["Nightlife","Bars","Lounges","Italian","Restaurants"]}

He also convinced me to remove an already existing set, which he charged me for.\n\nI went back for fills, one had to be removed because it was half off (normal for me but with paying so much more I thought maybe it wouldn't happen) and the fills were great and fast. Beautiful job but still way more expensive than I'm used to with nothing different or more special than any other nail salon. \n\nUnfortunately, I probably won't return and will continue to go to my regular salon because this salon is way more expensive.

{"stars":3,"text":"I've been to Yakitori Boy a few times both for in-dining and ordering to-go. My experience with Yakitori Boy is that once you take away the wrappings and glitter\/glam. The food really does have much to be desired. In terms of an izakaya-style eatery, Yakitori Boy is only okay.\n\n+PARKING: Basically non-existent. Street parking only. Which is typical for the Chinatown area.\n\n+INTERIOR: Great bar-like atmosphere to hang out with friends (pre-covid). The lighting is very ambient and the interior is dark and intimate. Great for small parties or even couples looking for a late-night dinner. But that's the appeal of Yakitori Boy I guess. Not many places in Chinatown have this lounge\/pub-type of feel and a lot of younger people like to frequent Yakitori Boy.\n\n+FOOD: The main attraction to Yakitori Boy is their variety of discounted happy hour skewers. The best ones I would say would be the CHICKEN skewers and BACON QUAIL EGG skewers. Skip on the ribeye skewers because the meat it too overcooked and tough. I would say stick to their fried foods and yakitori because the quality of sushi here is not worth it. I've tried both their Chef Roll (a crab, caviar [masago], avocado, and cucumber) and Volcano Roll (spicy tuna, caviar [masago], avocado). The rolls are miniscule and easily half the size of a standard 8-piece roll. I really don't think the sushi here is anything to write home about. I will say they have a huge menu with a wide-variety of offerings. So there's definitely something for everyone.\n\n+PRICE: No way would I pay full price for Yakitori Boy's offerings. Their happy hour prices are a much better deal. Paying full price for their fare would be a rip-off. The skewers go for $1 on Tuesdays and their drinks are usually around $3-$6 during happy hour. \n\nOverall: Yakitori Boy is not the place to go if you're looking for good food. Good atmosphere to have a good time. But, I've experienced better food at other izakaya bars before. I think ordering to-go has helped me peel back the glamour of their atmosphere and see that their food is sub-par and ok at best. Can't comment on their karaoke.","categories":["Japanese","Sushi Bars","Karaoke","Nightlife","Restaurants"]}

{"stars":3,"text":"Alright, let's jump into this. After pizza my second favorite food is breakfast. I can eat it any meal, I can eat it every meal! So as a sweet lunch craving hit me at work I jumped on yelp to figure out where to try.   All I saw was Dutch Baby, and my choice was made.\n\nLocated at the very edge of a shopping center, OPH is extremely easy to find and find parking at.  They have a patio outback that looks set (once we finally finish with 5th round winter). The inside is well kept, but definitely outdated. Everything seemed clean.\n\nMy waiter was, standoffish? He wasn't flat out rude, but he definitely lacked any personality.\n\nI ordered a large orange juice, because I've been craving fresh squeezed juice for a few days.  When it arrived I had to ask if it was the large, it was smaller than the water glass. I put the straw in the water glass for a size reference, see pics.  I also immediately ordered the Dutch Baby (if you go, please note that they do take longer to prepare) and a side of what is suppose to be the best bacon in town.\n\nThe plate of toppings for the Dutch Baby arrived first, butter, syrup, powdered sugar, and lemon wedges.\n\nThe Dutch Baby and bacon were delivered together, and the main course was fresh from the oven so it was steaming hot. The bacon temp was cooled off by the time it was in front of me.\n\nI dove into the Dutch Baby while it was still hot, overall it was a solid win. Creamy custard like bottom with nice crisp (though burned) sides.  I had most of it with just butter and syrup. As I was reaching my full point I did squeeze some lemon juice on top to enjoy that sweet\/tart combo that is really good. For the price, just under $10, this is a mountain of food and I did enjoy it. I even left a lot on the plate.\n\nLet's talk about the bacon, I have never felt more disappointed by thick cut bacon. It's bacon! It's bacon as a side that cost $5! How can it get messed up?? Some how, it did. You know how people fall into either the chewy or crispy bacon categories, this bacon would piss off both sides. It lacked a real clear picture of what it was supposed to be, not seasoned, greasy, cold, chewy, and slightly burnt....My soul was sad.\n\nTotal cost (without tip) $19.91 for a juice, bacon, and entree.

{"stars":3,"text":"Similarity between Hiroba and Rickshaw are apparent as they are yet another spin off from staff of the two previous places (most the better sushi places in Reno\/Sparks are ventures of former staff members of previous joints.  The ones that fail tend to be business opportunists that aren't familiar with the ins and outs of AYCE reno style sushi).\n\nThe space is cute, but not professional looking imo.  Looks like it was decorated via an IKEA run and a weekend bribing friends with beer and pizza for painting and decorating.  There is something cold and not cozy about the space, I think there is too much space without any softening elements like plants or textiles.  \n\nThe staff is friendly and they seem happy to be there.  The waitresses are young and pretty, but seem inexperienced and very um, unfocused?  Still, they have good upbeat and helpful attitudes and their skills I'm sure will improve with time.  The jail theme includes Black and White striped uniforms for the chefs, but I think they got the stripes wrong, they are vertical instead of horizontal, so they look more like umpire pajamas. heh.\n\nThe food is solid.  Tightly rolled and presented nicely.  I do think the menu leans towards too many similar elements (lots of crystal shrimp, krab mix, avocado, sweet sauced rolls), but a few unique and delicious ones. .  I didn't like their seared scallop as it was barely seared, mostly raw and was seared wet so there was no nice crust formed just a few faint char marks on still slimy translucent scallop.  There was a roll called Sushi Virgin, which was a tempura vegetarian roll with tamago and it was so gross.  If this was my first experience with \"sushi\" I'd never want more.  There were other really pretty and well presented rolls though, a pretty tuna based one that looked like a blossom, and a roll featured fried clam strips which was unique and delicious.  The mango sauce one on of the rolls was fantastic.  really fresh vibrant flavor that tasted like fresh mango puree.  \n\noverall I think they are a nice addition to the Spanish Springs area dining.  I probably won't drive all the way out to the far end of Sparks just for sushi here, but I'd eat here if I was in the neighborhood.  \n\nActually I'm kind of overwhelmed and bored by the plethora of AYCE sushi places in Reno.  I wish we had a nice authentic Japanese restaurant that treated sushi like an art and crafted small delicate bites of exquisite quality fish instead of this fast food rock n roll AYCE sushi culture that dominates this area.  Not that the AYCE places here are bad, they are great for casual meals but it's really not the same.","categories":["Restaurants","Sushi Bars","Korean"]}

{"stars":3,"text":"I really wanted to like it here, but I may be too much of a traditionalist when it comes to Vietnamese food - and the staple Pho, in general. Husband and I ordered iced coffees, raw flank, and 2 Phos. The iced coffee was good, but not Vietnamese. The cardamom was very overpowering and seemed thick or gritty. I enjoyed the raw flank the most, as it had a nice balance of acidity and spice, but the flank was way too thick. We got the traditional Phos, and there are good and bad things to discuss. First, the meat was very tender, but there wasn't enough. The broth is tasty, but it's not a pho broth. Sorry. It was more like a miso broth to me. Pho broth is supposed to be clear, clean, and unmuddled. To a non-Pho-natic, it may be a very delicious and budget friendly experience. Had to ask for hoisin and Sriracha, and the bean sprouts were weird. In its own right, it'll do well with the neighborhood and for those who want to try something \"cool\". I would recommend a bench or something in front of the restaurant so you can have somewhere to wait instead of just awkwardly hovering until they call you in, which is what we had to do.","categories":["Restaurants","Thai","Vietnamese","American (New)"]}

{"stars":3,"text":"This weekend, my family and I came in for the R+L Carriers New Orleans Bowl. It was our first stay at a Hyatt. The very first thing I noticed about this hotel is that self-parking can be daunting. Now, if you were to simply use the valet parking service, things would be much easier, but unfortunately, my father is the kind of person who will never trust another person with his SUV or luggage. Regardless, the entrance from the parking tower on the second floor to the lobby is a confusing maze. Yes, there is signage but it is still off-putting to say the least. Check-in itself was easy. The man at the front-desk was extremely polite and very helpful. Even in the midst of the insanity, check-in was snappy. Please note, however, that if check-in is very busy, it is possible to check yourself in using the kiosks to the right of the front desk. Now comes my favorite part: the elevators. I know everyone says that they're confusing, and don't get me wrong, they are, but for someone like me who LOVES gadgets, it took me no time to figure out how to use it. (The layout of the elevator system is another story entirely.) The man at the front desk attempted to explain to my mother how it works, but to no avail. Just in case you're considering staying here, I'll give you a little hint: pass your key card under the Dialpad on the color-changing light and it will automatically call the appropriate elevator and send it to your room. When swiped on any floor but your own, the elevator will send you to your floor. When on your own floor, swiping your card will send you to the 3rd floor. In terms of layout, however, the elevators were poorly placed. In order to get to them from the lobby, you must take two escalators (or an elevator, alternatively) up two floors to the main atrium where you then have to make a trek across to the elevator banks. It is quite inconvenient to say the least, and I have a feeling that aesthetic appeal is the idea behind this layout (read: They want you to stop and spend money at the bar and restaurants on your way up.) Now, onto the guestrooms. My family and I booked two adjoined rooms: one king and a 2-queen room. They were decently spacious, but, again, the layout is disconcerting. Upon entering the room, there is a bathroom to either your right or left (depending on the room) and then an armoir with your iron, ironing board, extra blankets, etc. Then, to one side of the armoir (again, depending on the room) you will see a doorway into the actual bedroom. I found them to be very uninviting and, if in a hurry, difficult to maneuver about in. The beds were fairly comfortable - probably just as good as your typical Holiday Inn - and the linens were very clean and fresh. The bathrooms were very posh. I loved the chrome and stainless. All of the fixtures were pleasantly modern, and the shower in our King room was very nicely tiled (i was in love with it, not going to lie). Next, price and value. For my family of 5 to stay in a king room and a double-queen room, before taxes, it cost us $225 per night. The rooms were $150\/night each, but we received a 50% family discount on the double-queen room. I felt that this was a decent incentive for such a luxurious accommodation. The price of everything else, however, was outrageous. Inside this hotel is a 24 hour store where you can buy drinks, food, and other essentials, in addition to gifts and baked goods. This is very nice and very convenient, but $10 for a dry ham and cheese sandwich? No, thank you. Regular-sized bottled soft drinks were $3\/bottle or 2 for $5. Considering the convenience, this wasn't a big deal to me. Everything else was ridiculous though. We bought two pizzas from Consegna Pizza in the main atrium for $15 per pizza. These were said to be 18\" pizzas, but, upon opening the box, we noticed that they were probably 2-3 inches smaller than the size that the box leads you to believe that they are. On top of this, they were very thin, had little sauce, and were quite bland and dry. Again, I realize the convenience of being able to buy this within the same building that you're staying, but $15 for an $8 pizza is unbelievable. One other complaint I have that really annoyed me was that our king room was not reset before we checked in. I noticed that the fridge in the queen room had about 10 bottles of water in it. The king room did not have this. So, I called the front desk asking if these were provided by the hotel, or if they were left by someone else. I was then told that the king room was used as a \"showroom\" and was not restocked before our arrival. Regardless, we were not going to drink them at $4 per bottle. I wasn't even aware that they were $4 because there was not a single sign. The only sign I saw for the price of water was for the large 32 ounce bottle of Aquafina in the armoir. The bottles in the fridge were much smaller and were a different, local brand, but for the same price. All in all, the stay was nice, but almost not worth it.","categories":["Hotels & Travel","Venues & Event Spaces","Hotels","Event Planning & Services"]}

My husband and I looked at the place to see a menu and decided that we would stop in after dinner with our guests. The woman behind the counter was very nice and said she would have a table ready for us when we got back, which was excellent service. When we returned the table was nicely set for us with waters ready. We reviewed the menu and were ready to order but had to wait nearly 15 minutes until someone came to take out order. When she did come by, she only took our drinks order first...making us wait another 10 minutes before we could order our crepes. They also forgot to bring out a cup for my Aunts tea so she had to wait to drink her tea. The woman said she would return with one....eventually, after waiting what seemed like 10 minutes, my aunt just requested a cup. The crepes came out very slow. We were all done with our drinks by the time they came out. The saving grace for this review was that the crepes were good. We had the Nutella and banana one and their special for the day....apple pie crepe. Both were great but we waited far too long. we arrived at 8pm and finished with drinks and dessert at 9:30. 85% of that time was spent waiting for service.

I suggested this restaurant for my friends for lunch to celebrate one friend leaving the country. We made a reservation and when we arrived (about 10 minutes early) there was so much confusion at the hostess station. Because half of my group was there and the other half went looking for parking, Hostess #1 told us we could not be seated until the full party arrived. Ok, I've heard that before from other restaurants. No big deal. Of course, Center City parking is atrocious, so we knew traffic would be killer. While waiting, more groups arrived leading to more confusion as to which group was which. Hostess #2 pointed her finger at us asking which party we were. My one friend was offended by the pointing but I calmed her down. Another offense was seeing another half group being offered to be seated by Hostess #1! Not that we were waiting 10 minutes standing in the way of the door or nothing... :eyeroll: By this time, our original reservation time arrived. And my half group arrived. I was asked for the third time by Hostess #1 if my party number remained the same. I said \"yes\" in an obviously irritated tone. Did we transform into indecisive children with no money??  \n\nNow we are waiting to be seated as a whole but Hostess #1 said that our original table was changed because another group wanted to move from their table. So we had to wait once again for the table setting to be changed. Really? The anger fumes were charging up inside. Oh if the wait service was sub par, then I knew it was time to walk out. Oh DelFrisco's hosts, why did you mess up a good thing? It pains me because I work in food service and the hospitality and consideration was NOT there.\n\nFinally seated, the area was chilly and very open! Not that we were looking for seclusion but I surely didn't want to see every guest coming in. This was probably a complaint from the other group. Anyway, our waiter, Gary was awesome. Very knowledgeable, friendly and attentive! Even helped one of my friends who has a tree nut allergy to choose the better, non-lethal dessert for her lol. \n\nI had the avocado chicken wrap with quinoa and it was very flavorful! My friends had the cheesesteak - a great choice by the way because it was oh so right - cheesy, seasoned well and hot. One other friend had the meatloaf and mashed potatoes. Those potatoes - oh my goodness!! The seasonings with a hint of spiciness and the temperature - delightful. My friend really liked the meatloaf too.\n\nDessert was great too - I had the cheesecake which was so creamy and smooth with a touch of sweetness. A few other friends had the chocolate mousse which they said was really good. One friend was a bit turned off by the dark chocolate because she wasn't expecting it.\n\nI would come back to DelFrisco's for the food itself!

I have also had a Grouper sandwich at the fish camp and a pork bun  from Anise's stall I wasn't a huge fan of. I feel like it is always hit or miss whether or not I will enjoy my meal.

You're a bright spot in my neighborhood of establishments that won't admit me without a union card, you're food is very good, and you're atmosphere is very nice.... but here are some things that are preventing more stars.  I was with a friend who knows and likes her wine, she ordered a bottle of her favorite (you had it! good for you!) It was not chilled.... the fridges were out or something??? Then she wanted to go for round two! It was your last bottle!  Your humbled and red faced bartender offered to comp whatever bottle she wanted next, so that's good.... but then we ordered food, calamari and muscles, I was a big fan, loved the muscle broth! The calamari was decent, and then we ordered the chorizo and roasted red pepper pizza, delicious! awesome! but then the mac and cheese I ordered never came out, apparently it was forgotten in the broiler!  mac and cheese FAIL! I really judge a place by the mac and cheese so I guess I'll just have to come back.  But my real beef was it was after 8 pm and there were only 2-3 tables eating in the entire place.... so maybe that makes it easier to forget? not really a good excuse..... I think you have great potential, you just need to tighten up your ship a little bit and you'll be just fine.  I'll be back.\n\nlove,\nKristin","categories":["Restaurants","Breakfast & Brunch","American (New)"]}

As soon as you enter Culinaria they have a nice selection of homemade desserts and fresh baked breads.  We had to grab some of the chocolate cake bunnies & cupcakes for our Easter picnic. The Deli has a full line of Boar's Head delicatessens & cheeses, a little expensive if you ask me but well worth it.  We got the Head cheese, Honey ham & White American to stuff into some of the fresh baked sub buns for our picnic at the Zoo. We also picked up some bright red heirloom tomatoes , they were sweet & delicious.  The head lettuce was 2 dollars & had more copper color then a brand new penny.  Its nice to have a market downtown so you don't have to venture out  to find a local grocery store when you only need a couple things.  Parking was tight when we went, but we lucked out after a few trips around the block and found a parking spot in front of the door on that rainy night.  The cashier was super friendly & had a manager run up stairs to grab free packets of mayo  for our subs ( I would have ran up there myself but my thighs exploded after my 10 story climb to go down the slide at the City Museum).","categories":["Flowers & Gifts","Department Stores","Bakeries","Shopping","Grocery","Florists","Food","Health & Medical","Fashion","Pharmacy"]}

The steak and egg was okay, the salad was nice and the dressing was really good with the pickled Diakon.  My Bun was alright, the pork was really fatty but the.lemongrass flavor paired well with the sauce, cucumber and mint. That being said I've had a lot of Vietnamese food in general and around the area, so neither of us at the table were highly impressed. The atmospherics were really weird too. There are random plants and neon pink and green paint colors. The tables are basic and wobbly but the chairs are a nice tufted back black dining chair.

The bar is not utilized at all and is completely covered in mirrors.

They also had snacks too but I already ate. One neat thing is you are able to bring a unopened water bottle with you - the website says \"Water - up to 1 liter in a factory sealed or empty bottle\" but I just brought the regular 16.9 fl oz. since I didn't have space in my bag. I didn't have any issues with security when I brought it in. \n\nBefore buying tickets, I read some reviews about seating and read how some people had obstructed views in the balcony, mezzanine, and loge areas so I played it safe and got Pit - GA seats. When I got to the venue, I could see how the balcony seats weren't right by the very front of the balcony which I'm assuming is for safety reasons but if you're not in the first row, I can imagine how it may be difficult to see. I attached a picture but not sure if you're able to zoom and see what I'm talking about.

Everyone is running around, grabbing things off shelves like they are nuts. I went on a Tuesday during the day, thinking it wouldn't be as bad, but it is really always insane in there no matter what. To add to the hoopla, the floor staff is constantly stocking everything, taking up half of the already tiny space. As another reviewer mentioned, it is hard not to feel like you are just in the way and unwelcomed. At one point, I found myself standing off to the side, avoiding speed-demon shoppers and stockers, wearily waiting to maybe get some yogurt because I didn't want to get run over by a basket while trying to cross the aisle, thinking to myself \"OMG, Sarah, I know you love your honey-flavored non-fat Greek yogurt too, but do you really have to injure someone to get it?\" \n\nRidiculous.\n\nOn the positive side, the sales staff there are helpful if you have questions, and the store is clean.

I don't book for washes as I can bathe them at home, and was very disappointed they couldn't be groomed that day.  I made another appointment a couple weeks later; they called to cancel and re-schedule.  The re-schedule was also ultimately cancelled as their groomer called off.  Whomever called me (possibly the manager?) was very apologetic and offered a 25% discount for the next time I used their services.  When I did finally get the dogs groomed the 25% off was not applied.  I took both dogs in today for full grooms; the groomer was significantly late and not the least bit apologetic as far as I could tell. The other employee did apologize.

The chicken in curry sauce was tasty and will probably be the dish I would get if\/when I return (they have a lunch menu, so that's an option).  The spicy noodle dish comprised toothsome broad noodles in a tasty sauce, but could have had more veggies; it's a fine option if you're in the mood for broad noodles.  \n\nOf the desserts, the poached pear was meh (I was hoping for a sangria-like wine-and-citrus infused fruit, but instead got a pear boiled in red wine); at least it came with some ice cream.

The price $2.50 a slice was pretty decent. The reason I am giving 2 stars is because when I checked in up popped a coupon for a free fountain soda. I love coupons and freebies. I asked the waitress if I could get the soda. She said no it's not good at this location. I felt dejected as no soda for me. I checked in a couple more times and up popped the coupon each time at this location. See my pictures. She will not be getting a tip because of not honoring the coupon. Sadly I will not be back.

Easy parking access, great hours, karaoke, bowling, and giant games for you to enjoy.  Once you dig a little deeper, you realize that PBS isn't quite as sweet as it seems.  \n\nThe space is large and well-appointed, with plenty of seating for small or large groups in several different zones.  There are quite a few activities available, but the caveat is that you'll pay a premium for 95% of them.  Table-top board games are free.  Everything else from giant Scrabble to Foosball will cost you.  The private karaoke rooms have a fee as well, but that's actually a pretty decent deal if you attend with a group.\n\nThe food at PBS is passable, but I've yet to be delighted by anything on the menu.  I'd love to see more well-seasoned food, and a few more menu options, particularly for the vegetarian\/vegan crew.  Some of the servers I've encountered were decent, and a few have left a bit to be desired. I don't think this is the fault or the intent of the serving staff, but the team may benefit from more training on expectations and general customer service and care.\n\nOverall, PBS is a decent time.

Small, tiny, and flavorless. They came out burned, and not just a little charred. You lost all the meat if you tried to pull it off.

There was about a 1\/4 cup of shredded cheese sprinkled sparingly on rock hard fries.  Not rock hard because they were cold (I ate them immediately so they were still warm), they were just overcooked, or whatever you do to make fries hard and chewy.  I can't believe I spent $7 on such a puny order of cheese fries, especially when there was hardly any cheese.  If the fries weren't God Awful I would have put my own cheese on.  I'm a fry lover, this was the first time in my life I haven't finished an order.  \n\nThe Good News:  Their pizza is shockingly good!

We waited a total of 30 min (timed from standing in line to having our order in hand), although some people were in line for roughly 40 min.  Is the food worth the wait in line? Honestly,  no.  Although I hear the daifuku is amazing; I wouldn't know though,  they were all sold out of them by the time I was there. For those already familiar with the matcha dessert joints around the world,  you'll find pretty standard fare here - soft ice cream,  drinks (hot and cold), parfaits and shaved ice. One difference is that they serve daifuku, \"cookie puffs\", tarts and cakes as well.  Another bonus: a lot of yuzu (Japanese citrus - and one of my faves!) is featured on the menu.  \n\nMy friends ordered the chiffon parfait - moist, subtle matcha flavor for the chiffon. I personally would have liked the cake to have a bit more matcha flavor to it.  One friend said the portion size was a little too small.  Both friends said they enjoyed the parfait, but agreed that they wouldn't wait in such a long line for the same item.  My friend and I both ordered the yuzu float- mine with matcha ice cream,  hers with a matcha- vanilla twist. (it's recommended on the menu that those \"new\" to matcha get the matcha- vanilla twist ice cream to curb its bitterness; I had no issues with the straight up matcha). Standard drink size,  chunks of yuzu peel in the drink. Good strong matcha flavor to the soft cream.  Nice refreshing drink for a hot day.  Once again,  an item not worth waiting 30 min for though.  \n\nService seemed fairly friendly; not particularly speedy, but given the time it takes to scoop out the parfait items (which seemed to be the most popular order), I guess it's fairly understandable. \n\nIt's a fairly small establishment with limited seating.  Didn't seem ideal for large groups as most of the tables just sit 2 unless you move tables around.  There is just one large table, and some bar style seating along the front window.  \n\nPaid street parking out front (limited, due to all the other nearby businesses).

We found out very quickly that our unfortunate young waiter had the entire place to himself...I should note that he also mentioned it was his first night.   Ok, understandable...we will cut him a little slack.  He did take drink orders (~15 mins. after we arrived) and proceeded to bring them out one by one.  One person asked for the wine list (not provided to us initially) and ordered one glass of wine.  Ten mins. later, no wine but our waiter took appetizer orders.   We received them about twenty mins. later, and then asked to place our dinner orders.  We did so...still no wine, though.   When our friend inquired, the waiter tells us that he has no liquor license to serve.  Apparently neither does the manager (?) who is now helping to run food and drinks out, as one member of our party asked him why our waiter was working alone.  The only person who can serve the wine is the chef...whom we can see working very hard and appeared to be alone in the kitchen.  After the third request, the wine was finally served by the chef who came out from the back hurriedly to drop it off.   The manager did come around and offer us refills on other drinks during our wait; he did what he could with a friendly demeanor.   We received our salads after another measurable amount of time. After another wait, our dinners then arrived.   Then yet another delay to pay our bills.  Most of our party ended up leaving around 915-930 P.M., thus making the entire experience around 3 hours long.\nI do want to mention that despite our long wait, the food was delicious.  House salad had a light homemade vinaigrette which was very authentic in flavor.   Hummus was creamy and flavorful (although could have been served with more pita bread for the amount of hummus provided).  I chose the vegetarian dolmathes served with rice and Greek beans which was amazing.  All other party members also agreed the food was good, and this was my sole reason for giving 3 vs. 2 stars.  However, the service lacked overall and I truly felt badly for our overworked waiter.

Ambiance is very cool and then the ordering begins...politely asked our server Tyler if the bartender can make a special ginger beer with fresh cucumber and my drink came out very refreshing and tasty.  Now, the part that gives them a lower score is the food.  I ordered a sesame ahi tuna bowl.  I read the ingredients one by one and I was asked by the server that I have a choice of quinoa or rice and I picked quinoa.  So there it is, then my order came and I started to eat and discovered corn mixed with quinoa.  It's so happened that I cannot digest corn and so I asked Tyler as to why there is corn and the menu doesn't have it, he said the quinoa is mixed with corn.  There you have my surprised! So, didn't finished the food and just don't want to wait another order made as the quinoa was already mixed with corn.  Now, Tyler face was also disappointing to see as he quickly grab the bowl and rushed to check in with the kitchen to find out why there is corn.  Oh well, would I try again this place, not really as their other restaurants that I gave 5 stars is just next door.","categories":["Food","Tapas Bars","Gluten-Free","Tacos","Restaurants","Latin American","Tapas\/Small Plates","Breakfast & Brunch","Bars","Mexican","Event Planning & Services","Caterers","Nightlife"]}

I stood there for at least a minute- no response. Then, when someone came up behind me, a dude who had been sitting in the customer area went behind the counter and asked me what I wanted. When I gestured to the bag of day old bagels in my hand, he asked, 'is that all you're getting?' Um yeah.

It's almost like they don't want me to be.\n\nRecently 3 of us walked over to Seven for some snacks. We scored the table by the piano with the windows open for a great cross breeze. There were no stools available but at least we had a place to eat. One guest sat on the piano bench and was told to get up, that it's not a place to sit. Odd. I'm pretty sure that's exactly what it's for. Oh well. A smorgasbord of appetizers came out with sliders, fries and some very dry steak bites. We ate and left. \n\nThe food is mostly good and the prices fair.\nPulled-Pork Sliders $10 are moist and delicious\nParmesan & Truffle Fries or overplayed.

I have a family member who works at an out of state repair shop and had some issues with my check engine light and my clutch squeeking. Brought my car in and within about 2 hours received an e-mail bill for $1200...no phone call until about 20 minutes after I see this e-mail. Included in this bill were those frill service charges such as brake line flushing, etc which were about $400 of the bill. $125 was the diagnostics for the check engine and the rest was about $600 for an O2 sensor replacement. I picked up the phone and called my family member and gave my VIN and we discussed that this part is about $200 but then it my be difficult to change myself without a lift. I called back Pinnacle and talked them down a bit but instead of getting an OEM part, they were offering me an aftermarket sensor. After paying in cash, we decided on about $400 for the part and labor to install, which was probably about $100 more than really what is reasonable when you think about labor and expertise. I fully support honest money making, but it's bad to take any customer and try to squeeze money out of them. I have taken my business elsewhere, even though they are very reliable and despite what other reviewers say, they are quite nice.

We were not greeted when we arrived and the hostess seemed scattered even though we were the only guests in the waiting area at that time. \n\nAs we entered the dining area, the hostess then decided with another staff member (I believe she was the manager) to move us to a different table than the one they had us down for originally \"because this one is better\". The table ended up being the first table upon entering so it was very loud and we could hear all the staff conversations, kitchen door opening\/closing, etc. There was only one other guest in the dining room at that time - not sure why the change and why we weren't consulted about it. \n\nOur waiter Bill was prompt. However, he didn't ask us if we were celebrating anything special, didn't ask how our meal was while we were dining, didn't ask if we'd like coffee with our dessert, etc. He did however do things like this for the table next to us which left a bad taste in my mouth. Also, the bill presenter was visibly dirty and sticky. \n\nWhen we left, it wasn't until we were almost out the door when one of the two hostesses who were standing at the podium finally looked up and told us to \"have a good one\".\n\nTip: Make sure your staff knows how to properly pronounce Monet.","categories":["American (Traditional)","American (New)","Hotels & Travel","Breakfast & Brunch","Bed & Breakfast","Event Planning & Services","Caterers","Venues & Event Spaces","Hotels","Restaurants"]}

It was very crowded and busy, so I won't hold that particular experience against them.\n\nBut after buying a pound of beans from Coffeebar today, I will say their procedure for handling the beans is terrible for anyone who values freshness--especially for what are the most expensive beans you can buy in this town ($18 a pound, which is over $1 per ounce).\n\nI'm  used to buying beans from a Bay Area roaster who's been around for decades. Their coffee (whole bean or ground) is packed in sealed bags, and each bag is dated so you know exactly how old the coffee you buy is. That's true for the beans you order from them online, or the beans you can buy in any grocery store in town. And the beans you buy directly from them online are beans that were roasted the day before they were shipped.\n\nNonetheless, I bought that pound of Coffeebar's Italian roast beans. I was surprised to see the bags weren't dated, however. I asked about this, and the staff assured me they're putting out fresh beans a couple time a week. But without dating each bag, it's impossible to keep track, and so a stray bag could easily end up getting shuffled around and overlooked on the shelf indefinitely, and they didn't have an answer for that. \n\nThey offered to fill a fresh bag for me, but that doesn't solve the problem that simply listing the roast date on each bag would. I can't understand why a coffee house that claims to be so coffee-quality conscious wouldn't do this for their customers.  And since the bags aren't vacuum packed or sealed, the beans age much faster while they're sitting around, even for just a week or so. (When I break the seal on a fresh bag of the coffee I normally buy, I grind about two or three days worth [6 or 8 oz by volume], and the remaining beans are re-sealed in a Food Saver bag.)\n\nSo I'll stick with my Bay Area roaster for now, thank you.","categories":["Bars","Coffee & Tea","Restaurants","Cafes","Food","Nightlife","Breakfast & Brunch","Wine Bars","Sandwiches"]}

The fries and root beer were great, but the coney sauce didn't taste nearly as good as we remembered.  We'll probably try again and hope the great taste returns.

The pricing however is a bit overpriced than other stores. \n\nMost of the time I'm just too lazy to run to Walmart, which is about an extra 5 minutes drive away. Overall, it's fairly clean and well air conditioned. \n\nA good thing is that it's never packed with people when I go. Which is a huge plus for me because I don't like overcrowded places. \n\nI'll find myself here for missing baking ingredients or if I need an extra jar of marinara sauce! They also allow purchase of money orders, which I know because my mom sends me out there for one at certain points in time. They also sell liquor which I have purchased on occasions for people's birthday.\n\nOverall, just another local grocery store for the community which I love.","categories":["Grocery","Food"]}

It also came with some celery sticks. \n\nGarlic fries was not really garlic fries? The fries came out with just shredded parmesan cheese on top. There was no sign of any garlic when you glance at it. There was a slight garlic taste to it. Besides appearance, the fries were pretty good. \n\nThe clam chowder was just okay.

Our server was very nice and attentive, but from start to finish, our meal was very slow.  We had a table of 10, but we did have reservations, and we were there for over 2.5 hours.  My perception was that the holdup was with the kitchen.  Our server was quick to respond with drinks and the things under her control.  Anything that was coming from the kitchen was slow to appear.  I love the list of German beer and wine!  There were mixed reviews from our table on the meals.  Two of us had the mussels which had a nice flavor, but they were full of grit.  One of mine had a pebble the size of a pearl. I would have been ok if it had just been one or two, but both orders had grit throughout.  One of our party had the special of the evening which was a whole fish, and he thought it was really good.  Another in our party had the steak and was pleased with her selection.  I'd like to see a little larger menu selection, but my perception is that menu items change and\/or rotate.  This experience aside, I would be willing to give it another try opting for some other selections.  However, I would stick with that German Kolsch I had.

Would have been nice if they had called to tell us their delivery person never arrived. Or given any sort of discount or coupon for the inconvenience and that our food was probably sitting for a while since it was almost 2 hours from the tome we ordered it until we actually got home to eat it. Their response was \"you could have called sooner\". We waited 15 minutes past the time it was supposed to be delivered, thinking it was probably on the way.

Read a few reviews, but like I said I was hungry, so we went in.  Let us be the judge!  Like some of the other reviews, they are accurate that this place is a bit loud.  Lots of people, wind killed any outdoor dining this day, and the inside was stuffed with people.  So, with that, and the acoustics, you get a pretty loud place.  It's a bar and grill, with TV's, Sports, the tall bar like tables, a corner watering hole.  20\/30 somethings, and young families seem to be regulars.  The bar action seemed to be brisk as well.  My wife had taco's, as did I.  She did fish and chicken and I did 2 chicken.  Both of mine were good.  I think I made the better pick.  I don't think she cared for the fish taco.  But, as for choices there were plenty (maybe too many), mostly typical bar food, and I think they would be well served to have a few less items on the menu and really concentrate on quality and the items they do best.   It's always a better model.  The poor staff was understaffed.  They worked hard and do their best.  Please give them a break.  I was hungry and cranky and I was able to wait a little more than I wanted to.  You can too.  This is at many places (the low staff levels).  So, I'm not going to rate service as a factor.  It was as good as it could be, and friendly.  \n\nI think Curb have an opportunity here, many good things going for it, with a little more work on the menu, try to tone down the sound, and I think they will see ratings start to rise.

I love the idea of a place I can get smaller plates of meats, cheeses, and a fresh salad.  Also, I think more places should serve crepes, because they are awesome and can be filled with anything, and eaten at any time.\n\nI don't mind the iPads, though I don't really think they add anything to the dining experience, and I'm curious as to how they would benefit the wait staff or the kitchen, because they don't interface with either.  \n\nCons-\n\nWine is good, but I have been under whelmed by the cocktails.  I get it, it's a wine bar, but they seem to have a great selection of bar accouterments and liquors, so I thought they could pull something off.  Both times I have been I have had cocktails that tasted entirely of gin or were too sweet.\n\nI enjoyed the \"French Tickler\" cheese plate, though I hate the name.  Gross.  Also, the rest of the food is just okay.  The crepe I had the first time was a little heavy and charred on one side, which is not something I associate with crepe texture.  The Crab, Avocado, and Grilled Asparagus salad needed some kind of dressing, even a light vinaigrette.  The lemon wedge I was served with it was not enough.  \n\nI'm happy to see other diners have had great experiences in terms of service, because that has not been our experience.

The oriental salad is mixed greens with mandarin orange slices.  The sumi salad is slaw-like with shredded cabbage, sliced almonds, and crispy wontons.\n\nThe noodles were piping HOT, so I ate both of my salads first and spread out the noodles to let them cool.  The salads were delish and I wish I had more of the oriental salad.  The yakiudon was very sweet and saucy and the noodles and shrimp were a little overdone, but still very tasty.

Quality and dedication to food is alway suffers when you lose control of who prepares the food. Most if not all airports use one company to employ all restaurant employees. That being said these employees could be working at different restaurants during any given month or even day. \n\nAs for the food, it's was ok... I got the Steak with Wiz ( that would be cheese Wiz for those who don't know the lingo). I opted out of onions or other add ons so I could get a better tastes of the meat it self. The meat was a little greasy , lack some flavor, but wasn't bad. The bread was soft and wasn't bad. They could have added more Wiz.  \n\nOver all it was ok, I'd like to try it at the original location to compare.

{"stars":3,"text":"Our friend absolutely loves this place but I find it to be just ok.  The salad bar alone gets 5 stars.  There are so many choices and everything is fresh and amazing.  I can come just for the salad bar alone.  The vibe is intimate.  Candle lit dinner surrounded by shelves of books (whisper Shakespeare sonnets to me, lol!). \n\nNow let's get to the entrees.  For the price you are paying, it really is just A-Ok.  I typically just get the filet when I go.  I got seafood a couple times at this place and am never impressed.  It's just mushy\/oily\/mushy.  Save your $$$ and just get beef.  I can't comment on the chicken since I've never had it.  I made the mistake of getting crab topping on my filet the other night.  I scraped off the mushy, mayo-ny mess (I think there was crab meat in it) that was ladled onto my filet and just ruined by dinner.  Good thing I filled myself up at the salad bar.  Again, just stay away from the seafood!  The scallops wrapped in bacon are good, but how can anything wrapped in bacon go wrong.\n\nThe creme brulee here is one of the best in my opinion.  It's just the perfect balance of custard and hard caramel.  A lot of places make the custard part too thick (deep ramekin) so when you scoop into it, you get too much custard to caramel ratio.  They got it just right here.  \n\nI really would have given this place 4 stars but the price just isn't worth it to me.  There are better places to go for a better price that have better food.  I guess 4 stars would be appropriate for the area but just a short drive across the bridge into Philly is where it's deserving.","categories":["Restaurants","American (Traditional)","Burgers","Steakhouses"]}

It was pretty average; I definitely do not think the prices align with the quality of the food. Center city has more cost friendly options that are better quality Italian to be honest.

For dinner we ordered the penne vodka which was okay- not the best I have tried And definitely not worth $22. We also ordered a dish that was a special on the menu that day- linguine with calamari, shrimp and scallops with pink sauce. This dish was the best out of all three things we ordered. However I don't know if it was worth $32. \nOn an additional note- I did feel the staff was a bit rude. Since my boyfriend and I are on the younger side (mid 20's), I felt they treated us less than the other customers who were on the older side(which was the majority of the clients:50+). My guess is because they assumed since we were young we wouldn't want to spend a lot but quite on the contrary we ended up spending over $100 and left a 22% tip. Additionally, They were slow to attend to our table and I had to ask multiple times for a wine list and no one really came to check up on us to see if we needed anything.

We loved having a living space separate from the bedroom. The first day our room was serviced we came back from a day out and discovered we had no bath towels and no garbage bag in 1 of the cans in the room. The next day no wash clothes and our trash was not taken out. The next day still no wash clothes, but we had clean bath towels AND got to keep our dirty ones from the day prior. One night there was some flooding on one of the floors, so in the morning the cracked tile floor in the elevator was puddled; understandable, but where was the wet floor sign? Tile is slick when wet. Speaking of the elevators, one of the two was down part of our stay. They are very slow. There was a mini fridge but no microwave. The fridge had stuff in it from a prior guest when we checked in. Again, the room was very nice, but the hotel lacked those little details that make you want to return.","categories":["Event Planning & Services","Hotels","Hotels & Travel"]}

Husband got the fried catfish and said it was the best he's ever had. The hot sauce they had on the table was the perfect compliment to my mahi tacos. \nI knocked 2 stars because of staff. I don't really want to go into detail, but to sum it up, just unprofessional and I expected more with the great reviews, the traffic, and the great food. Took awhile before the server came to our table for the first time- it was our first time here and we had already decided what we wanted to order. I never got a refill on my drink. \n\nI haven't been one to be too worried about covid but it did concern me, just from what I've seen other restaurants doing, that all the condiments were on the tables and they used their regular menus (not paper ones)... I just really hope these are being wiped down with sanitized after every person leaves  the staff all did have masks on, but the host also touched our silverware (it wasn't wrapped in a napkin or anything), to set it on our table. I dont mean to be a \"covid cop\" but I just feel like these are little things that dont take much, most restaurants are doing and can protect everyone. \n\nIt is nicely decorated, lots of cool things to look around at while waiting for your food.

This review is for the food in take out form only.\n\nPros:\n\nService was great and friendly.  I ordered a Shawarma platter and was eagerly greeted and taken care of right away.\n\nFood was plentiful - we received a massive amount of food for around 20 dollars (2 platters and a side of falafel).  The rice, chicken and garlic sauce were fine and similar to food carts in quality (what we expected).  Everything is served buffet-like style (food isn't made fresh except the chicken, which is cut fresh).  \n\nThe restaurant appeared very clean and comfortable.\n\nCons:\n\nThe food was generally okay.  The vegetables were limp and the tabbouleh was somewhat flavorless. The pita came straight from a bag (I guess a lot do, but it wasn't warmed or anything, nbd).  The falafels were actively bad and must have sat under the heat lamp for hours.  I won't order those again.  \n\nConclusion:  It's a fine quick stop on the way home and the friendly and inviting service will keep me coming back for a meal (2 meals, really) for under 10 bucks!","categories":["Middle Eastern","Butcher","Halal","Sandwiches","Delis","International Grocery","Desserts","Restaurants","Food","Grocery"]}

We easily got a table with a perfect view of the TV and were impressed that there were a bunch of Eagles fans already glued to the TVs as well. Bonus: there were plenty of high quality TVs throughout the two rooms and around the bar.\nWe were disappointed that the only special was $3.75 for a pint of Guinness. That's not exactly a special in my opinion... We shared an order of chicken quesadillas which were surprisingly good. They were filled with seasoned chicken, peppers, onions, mushrooms, and just the right amount of cheese. They were served with below average guacamole and sour cream that were clearly not homemade.  They were only $9 which was pretty reasonable as they filled us up for the remainder of the game.  From what I saw the wings and nachos looked decent and are on my list for next time. The service was decent too.\nI'll give Ten Stone another try but would like to see some decent specials.  Overall this place is just OK.

The wine list prices were decent. ($28 clos du bois pinot grigio)  The food prices on the other hand were definetly bumped up due to the location.It was  the same food you can get for $10 less on a less touristy street. Maine lobster(no sides) $29  Seafood stuffed filet, lobster tail $42    Sides were typical baked potato, creamed spinach, etc all around $6-$8  Service definetly lacked.  We ordered a bottle of wine and he didnt ask me if I wanted to try it first, he just poured us both a glass.  He never came back to refill our waters or wine.I had to ask for more water.  When I went to pour the wine, he had tied a napkin around the bottle, nice touch, only if it wasnt swimming in the ice water.  So as Im pouring... the ice cold water from the napkin is dripping all over me, the food, table, etc.  When he came by to take my plate away he somehow manged to spill the left over drawn butter from my plate all over me and the table and didnt say a word. Since I work in the industry, I wasnt going to make a big deal about it.  And of course I still left over 20%, I cant help myself.   Upon leaving another server told him to grab me a bag for the wine while they both watched me take the napkin off the bottle that was 1\/2 full.    So, as a local, will I be back?  probably not.

But it seems to me that a bar with an adrenaline-pumping, high energy image and a dedication to sports of all kinds should have a few more TVs.  Beyond the Edge offers NTN trivia every night, poker tournaments on Wednesdays, and Predators and Titans parties, but the atmosphere is just a bit lacking.\n\nBTE's drink selection is probably their best feature, and they offer specials pretty regularly.  The menu isn't bad but pretty typical for a bar--mini-pizzas, quesadillas, et cetera.  Their hummus pizza and sandwiches are decent, and prices are just cheap enough.  The Edge is located in the \"bar hole,\" so it pulls in quite a bit of traffic on weekends.  (Warning: this can often lead to belligerent crowds).  Darts and pool are available though boards and tables are a bit limited.  The patio is pretty lovely, but the decor and vibe indoors are a bit drab.\n\nThe staff is mostly friendly, however odds are good that service won't exactly be speedy.

I liked the mixture of flavers though, w a touch of cilantro .

{"stars":3,"text":"Looked at the menu ahead of time and couldn't wait to eat here. While our server Abby was an absolute delight, I really wish I got a traditional main course instead of opting for sushi. All the Asian dishes seemed really average.  The edamame was a little tough, dry and lacked salt, the pot stickers were a little bland and I couldn't tell you what was inside them. Side salad was great and I particularly liked the soy ginger dressing! It was also a plentiful salad in comparison to many sushi spots. The sushi was mediocre to below average. There was too much rice vs. ingredients and it was pretty gummy\/over cooked. The shrimp tempura roll had way too much mayonnaise that covered up the other flavors inside the roll and the Hoosier rolls steak was almost raw.  Perhaps this was a mis-order on my part, but I couldn't eat the steak on this roll.  I won't run back, but if my friends want to go here I'll order off the main menu and not the sushi fare.","categories":["Specialty Food","Sushi Bars","Food","Asian Fusion","Seafood Markets","Seafood","Restaurants"]}
{"stars":3,"text":"I had been looking forward to trying Kauboi for some time now and when my girlfriend suggested it, I jumped at the opportunity.  Saturday night, 7:30pm, the restaurant is full with one available table and two seats at the bar.  We opted for the bar so we could watch the action!  \nOverall, the food was fine.  Not bad, but unfortunately, not spectacular either.  We started with the pickle plate and the hamachi crudo over pears.  The pickles were delicious (I think this was my favorite dish of the night) and I was pleasantly surprised by the pickled apples and pineapples!  Wish there had been more of them on the plate.  The hamachi was okay.. a little fishy which indicated to me that it wasn't the freshest.  And for $17, 5 thin slices of hamachi did not impress.  Next up was the chicken thigh from the grill, a grilled squid, and a king oyster mushroom.  The chicken was good and a bigger portion than I expected.  It was however lacking some flavor.  The grill marks were good and the smokey flavor was there (perhaps even a little too charred), but the marinade was lacking.  Unfortunately, I felt the same way about the squid and the mushroom.  Not the freshest and lacking flavor.  It was so bland that instead of finishing this course off we decided to try another dish - perhaps we had just ordered wrong.  Insert duck fried rice.  Lots of flavor here - and those cracklins were spot on!  I've never had crispy crunches in my fried rice before but that was a winner.  However, for the price and the portion size, I felt a little ripped off.  \nOut the door was $100 for 2 women, each of us had 1 glass of sake and the above shared plates.  In my book, it was not worth the $100.  It was a fun experience, the restaurant vibe is great, but for the prices the food could use some upgrading.","categories":["Sushi Bars","Pubs","Gastropubs","Japanese","Restaurants","Czech","Nightlife","Bars"]}

Sadly for me the pastor and chorizo were almost inedible to me due to the mushy grainy texture of the chorizo and asada. I'm not sure if that's their usual, but to me, it was very unusual (and unappetizing). That said, I would most certainly come back and try some other dishes though.

{"stars":3,"text":"I come here about once a year to get to-go food when I have a fried seafood hankering.  As others have said, it is located on a pretty sketchy stretch of Nebraska Avenue, so use your common sense when you go.\n\nInside, there are about eight tables to eat at, a few refrigerated cases showing all the fresh fish available, including specialty items like fish heads and grouper cheeks, and the order counter.   There is also a smell inside; I'm sure with all the seafood they are dealing with it's inevitable, but I can only take it in small doses.\n\nI ordered a fried seafood platter.  This particular platter came with fried shrimp, scallops, and clams, with sides of hushpuppies and fries. Make sure you ask for the cocktail and tartar sauce to go with it - they are really good.  My favorite parts of the platter were the hushpuppies and shrimp.  Clams were good but not much flavor, and the scallops were just eh.  Portion size was HUGE, easily enough for three meals.\n\nI've heard that they will clean fish that you catch for a fee, so it's something to keep in mind if you hate that particular aspect of fishing.  The atmosphere is pretty run down and dingy, so that, combined with the smell, is why I recommend you get your food to-go.  However, the order taker was nice and efficient, food came out quickly, and it was still warm when I got home.","categories":["Seafood","Restaurants","Food"]}
{"stars":3,"text":"Oye, I'm on the fence for this one. It's just past 2 stars and is reaching out to the heavens for the 3 stars. (See what I did there? Added a bit of drama) Anyways, the food is satisfactory, but not great. The service is insanely slow, so don't eat in if you have any sort of plans afterwards.\n\nMyself and a party of ten had dinner here on a Saturday night. I was impressed as there was a steady crowd there the whole night. Not packed to the brim, but most of the tables had folks there. \n\nNow the food - I have to say they have a nice selection of typical and more traditional dishes. The price point is slightly higher than you'd expect for the quality of the food and the area. None of the dishes seemed to have much of the \"pow\" of flavor I usually like in Thai. This could be based on spicy heat or just spice in flavor, I got neither. My red curry was enjoyable, half the table got the crab fried rice, which they liked. The Asian Eggplant had a nice flavor, probably the best of it all. The portion size is medium.\n\nNow the service - I would attribute the slow service to the kitchen, since waitresses did try their best to get to every table and the food was always piping hot when it did finally arrive at the table. Our appetizers took well over a half hour to come out (we only had 4) and 3 out of 4 of them were fried and likely refrigerated or frozen beforehand (i.e. nothing that needs to be made fresh). It wasn't the size of the party either, since it seemed other tables were waiting just as long. The main dishes took yet another half hour or more after we finished our apps. My dish was incorrect when it came out (simple miscommunication), it took another half hour for the correct dish to arrive. Very strange. \n\nAnyways, if you have a small party, live in the area and have nowhere else to be after your meal, then this is an alright option. This will fill your Thai craving, if only barely.","categories":["Thai","Restaurants"]}

The pizza is good but not $30 a pie good. I would have paid the latter price either way because we really wanted pizza that evening but just a strange miscommunication on their part to which I will give the benefit of the doubt even though it seems pretty clear that I was overcharged in this specific instance.

One item to be aware of is that the walls don't go all the way up to the ceiling so whether you're getting a facial or a massage you will hear a noise from people in the hallway in the reception area.

I had the special-their version of chicken and waffles, and while the skin on the bird was light, crunchy and flavorful, the cornmeal waffle with bacon and honey was so dry and tasteless that it literally crumbled apart around my fork. Wait - I need a glass of water just remembering it... ahh. better.  Perhaps serving maple syrup with it would have helped, because it was way beyond the moisturizing properties of the additional honey I asked for.  The side of hashbrowns was marginal, because it was marinating in grease.  Brunch for 4 came to (gulp) $140.00 before tip (yes, we each had 2 mimosas, but still!).

Many are terribly nice old ladies, but a few, not so much.  One lady downright crabbed at me when I brought a purse I'd found upstairs with me while I continued to shop downstairs.  She snatched it from me, \"to keep behind the counter!\" and then complained loudly the whole time I was down there that, \"the big purse back we're tripping over back here\" belongs to, \"some lady who mistakenly brought it down.\" adding, \"I guess she didn't see all the signs!\"\n\nInstead of looking at all the signs (I went back and checked, there were three), I'd been looking at the stairs and railing.  They're pretty narrow and steep.  It's really easy to trip and fall.  Every time I've been there I've slipped or seen someone else slip.  Beware.\n\nLast complaint, which I do kinda understand, is that they sell all the dishes by FULL set.  You can't buy a plate, or just the teacups and saucers.  You must buy all 4 saucers, 3 teacups, 6 desert plates, 6 salad plates, 9 dinner plates and punch bowl.  Granted, it's under 20 dollars for the whole set...but I just want the teacups and saucers.

I believe it was because other customers were there. I was very quiet and polite about it, but I felt like she was more concern with the other customers hearing something that is quite normal. It made me look like an aggressor because she kept repeating that I should have come in, but I am a new mom and this is really just a treat. Which she knows because we've had very friendly conversations. I was not asking for a discount, but I thought she should know being that she suggested this gel polish (which isn't opi or cnd my go tos). My most recent visit was not as bubbly as before, but it was still pleasant. I would still recommend this place...just be ready for awkward tension if you point out something wrong.","categories":["Hair Removal","Eyelash Service","Waxing","Nail Salons","Professional Services","Beauty & Spas"]}

Not only do you get to pick a main entree but your party gets 15 sides (although you don't get to pick your sides). It was so cool. It was even more fun for me and the people I was with because it was our first experience with Korean food. The food is average and that's why I didn't give it 5 stars. The sides are good for the most part but some were not so good. I just wasn't a fan of some of the spices or the texture. \n\nBut, unlike a lot of the other reviews, my service was great. He was very nice and refilled our drinks often and checked on us multiple times.

We met there to celebrate Mom's 68th birthday; i.e., get her drunk.\n\nThe parking lot was packed.  Its really way too small, but it is also in Florida, so no land, but there is valet parking and well, he's cute so cough up a few bucks for the guy and have him park your car.\n\nWe were a party of 6 so we had a bit of a wait; no big deal.  We were sat probably within 15 minutes and Weez loved being a Picasso with her crayons on the paper table cloth.  \n\nDrinks were ordered and the first of Mom's $8 Cosmos arrived.  Sis, Sis' GF, Weez and I paced it with our drinks (Weez was throwing back an ICB...the lush).  Bro wasn't there yet; he was on call.\n\nNo apps, but sure salads and bread...oh, the bread was delish and warm!  No Annette to deliver the bread with her quick whit, but our server (I cannot remember his name) was just fine; he didn't receive a nickname.  This place was already super casual and welcomed my \"Cleveland Girl\" shirt and demin shorts (yeah, I rocked 'em) like it was a family reunion.\n\nFood was good.  It was healthy sized portions, delivered on time and hot.  Spot on!  Ooooh, crab legs...\n\nDuring dinner Mom ordered Cosmo #2.  It has been years since I've seen my mom drunk.  She's a happy drunk.  Funny too!  Livy threw back another ICB and yeah, we all had a second round as well.  Bro finally showed and we offered our leftovers; we are not part of the \"Clean Your Plate Club\" so there was plenty of food for him.\n\nOf course, we had to go potty...\n\nDear Ballyhoo: Holy Crow! Its hotter than Hades in the bathroom!  Let's get that fixed OK?  Thanks, Woz\n\nThe night was a good time.  Ballyhoo's service was good.  The food was excellent.  The drinks were cold.

{"stars":3,"text":"Jacques-Imo's probably deserves 4 stars if only the food was being rated. The problem is that when you wait 2.5 hours to eat at a restaurant, it's going to take mind blowing food to justify that wait. This food was not mind blowing. Good but not amazing. I would not wait in line again to eat here.\n\nI have never ever even seen a wait this long at a restaurant. The front bar area was COMPLETELY packed with people, and there were tons of people standing outside waiting... It's mind boggling how easily people accept the fact that you must wait at least 2 hours to eat at Jacques-Imo's.\n\nWe had corn bread, spinach salad, calamari, alligator cheese cake, blackened red fish, fried chicken, and creme brulee. Corn bread - AMAZING. Buttery, moist, and delicious. The fried oyster on the spinach salad was good, with a hint of Worcestershire sauce, which I thought was interesting. Calamari - almost mind blowing. The breading was SO tasty on the calamari... they were fried just right, highly recommend it! The alligator cheese cake was interesting, I can't really review it as cheese and creamy things aren't my cup of tea. The taste was a bit sour, and the texture is creamy. \n\nThe blackened red fish - the fish was so fresh and cooked just right, the crab hollandaise sauce that it came in was just so so. I prefer the fish by itself. The fried chicken was good, but after having Willie Mae's, it simply pales in comparison. The fried chicken at Jacque-Imo's is just okay, the breading was good but the meat was too dry.\n\nI wanted to try their mini cheese cakes for dessert, but they were out of it, so the waitress kindly brought us a complimentary creme brulee, which was good but not the best I've had.\n\nThe owner Jacque, actually came around to our table and asked how everything was. I figure that this earned the restaurant an extra star. He was really nice.\n\nBut I had to take off another star because I really really believe that the food isn't worth the wait. I really want to give it 4 stars, but then I remembered the grueling wait...... The only memorable food I had here was the corn bread and the calamari. If you've never been there, try going on Mon~Wed... Any night from Thur to Sun, you're going to be waiting a looooong while.","categories":["Seafood","Cajun\/Creole","Restaurants","Vegetarian"]}

The last time I went there I wanted to substitute something and I was informed they \"do not substitute  on Fridays, or Saturdays due to how busy it can get\".

If I had more options of what to choose from (without this sounding like I should go to a chain restaurant) then I would have enjoyed this Friday night dining experience better. \n\nThe seating outside was cramped as well but beautiful weather makes it worth it as long as you can grab the right spot. They tried to squeeze a couple in a 2 person table that was jammed between 2 other tables on both sides which clearly wasn't fit for anyone to sit in. My friend and I were about to leave so we offered them our table that had a little more room and they appreciated us and agreed where they were going to sit was not going to be satisfactory. \n\n50% of a restaurant experience is the actual customer service and the other 50% is food.

The salad was delicious, although it would have been better with some spring mix, or arugula mixed in. It was literally just beets nuts and goat cheese. But, to each is own!  When my mussels (in red sauce) came out, I was shocked to see like 8 mussels in the bowl. For $9. Seriously? It is listed as an appetizer, however I work in a seafood establishment and our appetizer mussels are a giant bowl for $8. Mussels are super cheap, I'm glad I didn't order the drunken clams, it probably would have been less than that. The red sauce it came it left a lot to be desired.

{"stars":3,"text":"I have a two sided review, so that is why I'm giving 3\/5. \n\nPros: We had a great time! The hour went by so fast because we were engaged the entire time. There was something for everyone and we were all involved in some way. \n\nCons: Room: there were a couple 'malfunctions' that the moderator needed to activate manually. We escaped in time, but could've been sooner if the malfunctions didn't happen. Management: I originally purchased two escape rooms thinking we had 14 people attending. Unfortunately five people were not able to attend and we did not need the second room. I called more than 24 hours in advance in order to cancel the second room however refunds apparently are not provided. This was never mentioned to me when I purchased the rooms and I never received any copy of the policies. The girl answering the phone was in communication with the owner and the owner was communicating through her, rather than calling me directly. Even when following up, the girl called me with messages from the owner. As a manager myself, this was very disappointing that the owner couldn't call me directly to address my concerns. So now I have a purchased room and am out of $215 until I use the room in the future. I HIGHLY suggest that you don't purchase a full room unless you have the money upfront from your friends, because you're not getting it back. I find it crazy that even giving more than 24 hours notice, there was nothing that could be done, especially since the room was booked on a Saturday night and I am sure would've been purchased by another party. Just beware. I also have not received my 'promo code' yet for my future room.... again, beware.","categories":["Escape Games","Active Life","Arts & Entertainment"]}

I don't typically write reviews, but after today's visit I feel the need to say something. I love this location, it's right in the middle of downtown, the staff are always fun and quirky, they always seem to be having a good day and it's always a pleasant experience. Today while waiting in line, I noticed a lot of flies, sadly they weren't only in the air but also around the bagels and bagel case. I mentioned this to the cashier and they stated that they are asked by the owner to have the garage door open for part of the day and it's hard to control, which I can understand.. but it is concerning when there is no screen on the bagel case or any other precaution to the bugs. This is not an out of sight out of mind restaurant where the kitchen is closed off, but rather one where you can see what you're getting which has always been an upside.

Why do I always have to give my Uber driver 5 stars even if I don't like them?","categories":["Fashion","Shopping","Men's Clothing","Women's Clothing","Department Stores","Children's Clothing"]}
{"stars":3,"text":"We stayed here on a recent trip to Nashville and selected the location because of the proximity to the airport (less than 1 mile away) and price compared to hotels in downtown.\n\nFirst glance, it's a very new property. The entry\/lobby area is going for the whole trendy look with a crecent shaped desk in the middle of the room, open on one end, not your standard hotel check in counter. There's apparently a 24 hour bar and \"restaurant\" connected to the desk, which means it's 2 feet away. We didn't test the bar and I think the restaurant is just mainly some pre-packaged foods that you can order, but I guess it's nice to have there if you're ever in need.\n\nLobby area is small, and there is a lot of furniture. It seemed like at all times there were masses of people camped out with their shoes off, laying on the couches, etc.\n\nThe room was clean, and spacious, but it seemed overly designed. It had a big sectional couch and an ottoman that jutted awkwardly into the middle of the room - we kept it up against the couch the whole time. There is a sink and refrigerator off by themselves in one corner, then a small desk across from it. The sitting area and bed are seperated by a half wall thing which just looked out of place. The sink was outside of the bathroom. Shower was big. However, the shower and toliet area was up against the wall where the window was, and left very little room between the bathroom wall and end of the bed. Maybe about 18 inches at the most. The whole thing just seemed very poorly designed - a lot of wasted space but at the same time cramped in areas that didn't need to be cramped.\n\nNo outlets next to the bed. Had to charge my cell phone across the room. Bathroom didn't have a fan. Stay here alone and leave the door open when you shower. No wall mounted or automatic temperature control on the thermostat, so I had to get up and adjust the heater three or four times during the night - one of those big loud fan units under the window.\n\nCloset is a joke. It's jammed behind the tv and next to the sink in one of the fake walls in the middle of the room. I was able to fit about 2 jackets and a couple of shirts in there, anything else would be out of reach.\n\nThe bed and pillows were comfortable, I will admit to that. And the room had a 42\" plasma TV, so that was a nice touch. \n\nOther than that, it was very mediocre. I think Hyatt is taking a stab at the \"middle of the road\" type hotel...this wasn't a Hyatt, just a Holiday Inn Express or a Hampton Inn with some newer furniture. Staff was pleasant, it's in a good area, lots of parking. There are about 20 other chain hotels within walking distance. I would stay here again if the price was the same, but if it was any higher, then I'd probably try somewhere else.","categories":["Hotels","Event Planning & Services","Venues & Event Spaces","Hotels & Travel"]}

The first few bites of the burger were amazing.  The bun is one of those buttery potato buns, which I love.  The toppings tasted pretty good.  But as I continued to eat the burger, the garlic mayo was just way too overwhelming.  And it kept falling apart.  And there were a few too many bright pink dots scattered throughout the meat.  Also, the meat itself didn't grab me like some of the other burger places around Philly do.\n\nAt $8.50, it was just a little bit too expensive for what it was.  \n\nBut I will be back for more of those fries.","categories":["Street Vendors","Food","Food Trucks"]}

The rolls were pretty creative, but a pet peeve of mine is too much rich mayo-laced sauce, which most of the rolls had. The fish didn't taste poor in quality but not the freshest either.\n\nThe takeout beer selection was awesome. Combine this with the fact that it is BYO (meaning you can drink what you buy) and it makes for some great sushi-beer pairings.\n\nOverall, when we have time for a sushi dinner, we will probably go elsewhere, but you could do a lot worse than Harusame, that's for sure.","categories":["Restaurants","Japanese"]}

I ordered my blinds with a sales person who is no longer working there. That is a good thing because he messed up my shutters and poor Morgan the installer was so upset about the fact he couldn't install the shutters. He took more measurements ( the sales guy was here 2x measuring) and told me he would be back and put me as a priority.  While he was here I told him about the small WIndow the original guy told me couldn't have a shutter due to its size. He said it could have one and he took measurements and said he was going to turn it in to the owner. I got a call one friday saying the parts were in but they couldn't schedule me to next thursday ( I'm thinking that's priority! !). I asked about the small window hoping the order was in and guess what it wasnt. I told the gal I wanted it and Morgan took measurements. Monday I get a call saying they don't need to keep the appointment tuesday to measure the window since Morgan did that already. I didn't get called about an appointment so I didn't know what she was talking about. I then asked for the price of the small window and she said they would get back to me. This is 2 days later and no call about the small window. I'm not sure it was ordered. I need 3 more windows done and I'm not sure I will use them. I never got an apology from the owner for the original inconvenience. I'm taking a 1\/2 day off work since they have to come back. I think my small window should be free.

They provide you a number and you seat yourself. They don't do substitutions, so if you don't eat hash browns you're not getting anything else. I watch my carb intake so when I ordered an omelet I wanted salad in place of both the hash browns and the biscuit, but they won't do that here-- not even for an up-charge. My dining companions got:\nThe Mac-- it's pasta with bacon, cheese, and tomato. It was good, but lacking flavor and needed salt. \nThe Beverly-- Breakfast biscuit Sammy-- very dry. Needed lots of ketchup. \nGravy doesn't taste like gravy-- more like flower. It's def made in house. $3.50 to add gravy, which was the worst I've ever had, was upsetting. \n\nOK, so the food wasn't amazing, or anything to bring us back, but the atmosphere was. There are a lot of people relaxing both inside and out, enjoying their meal and having a good time. There is a lounging area and the decorations are on point.

That's just for starters. \nNot thinking the bowl of soup would be considered an \"entree\" for your internet discount coupon, I also ordered the combo plate, with enchilada and burrito. First of all, the soup always comes out with the entrees, instead of being served first, so it can be enjoyed. Bringing it with the entree means some part of your dinner is going to get cold. Or in this case, colder. My chicken enchilada, besides lacking any flavor, was served at best warm. My beef burrito had parts that were absolutely still cold!

{"stars":3,"text":"The main reason that I am giving this restaurant 3 stars and not 4 is mainly due to the lack of attention the staff\/management gives to the front door. We frequent this place around twice a month and for past 6 months or so, the service has suffered. It takes quite a bit of time for a waitstaff member to come to the table and that's a little frustrating. Once they do come to the table, they are always nice, professional and efficient.  It seems that more often than not, they do not have enough waitstaff on hand and that is probably the issue here. Having said that, two weeks ago, we invited my boyfriend's father out for brunch and scuffled and rushed to be sure that we made it on time to have brunch. He was super excited to eat here because they have a pretty diverse menu with choices for everyone, the portions are nice and it was a new place for him to eat--something different! \n\nI have had nice food here in the past, and that is the reason we picked 13th Street Pub and Grill that Sunday. {I especially love the eggs benedict florentine and their bloody mary's are tasty!} My boyfriend's dad was really happy that we were going to spend some quality time with him and we were all pretty hungry and ready to get some yummy brunch in our bellies. We arrived, and my boyfriend dropped us off and parked the car (it was raining and isn't he quite the gentleman??), and so we made our way to the door, out of the rain, to wait for him. It is often that they have a sign near the door that requests that you seat yourself, but on this day, that was not the case. The sign asked us to wait to be seated. \n\nWe had one initial greeting by the friendly bartender, who assured us that someone would be with us shortly to seat us ......and then that was it.\n\nSo we waited like he asked us to......and waited, and waited, and waited.........and waited.........and waited.  Nothing. Not even eye contact. \n\nWe waited way too long in my humble opinion, while a ton of staff walked past us, swept the floors, and did everything else they could possibly do with themselves, except seat us. It was super disappointing, especially since this is the 3rd time it's happened in under 6 months and now we would have to find another place to eat and brave the rain. That sucked.  \n\nI do not personally believe that a staff member's 1st priority in a restaurant environment is anything other than greeting the customer and at least getting them sat with a drink order submitted and a menu in hand-even if they are super busy.\n\nI will try again of course, because I like the place, but I would suggest management reiterate to their staff the importance of greeting and seating the actual customers that come to enjoy their establishment so that they don't walk out!","categories":["Breweries","American (Traditional)","Restaurants","Bars","American (New)","Nightlife","Beer","Wine & Spirits","Food"]}

{"stars":3,"text":"Every time I come here, or drive by, I sing beauty school dropout from Grease to myself. There I go. I'm singing it again. No wonder why I live alone. \n\nAny way. This building is two stories, half the downstairs is TGI Friday's, the other is the Aveda Hair Institute, and the upstairs is all Aveda. The parking lot in front is small and shared. There is more parking in the rear of the building. For the institute, you should really call to set an appointment. Walking in and attempting to get an appointment can lead to disappointment. Their hours do seem to fluctuate. Also, the cost increases on the weekends, so take that into consideration.\n\nThey are not doing appointments for haircuts past 5pm. I have had my haircut here several times. Give them at least an hour of your schedule. They do have a tendency to make your hair big. I'm not sure if its the student, or the fact that we are in Louisiana, but the policy of \"go big or go home\" seems to be applied to your hair here. Last haircut I got here was only $18, so there is that. Can't complain. The students have to tell and instructor what they are going to do before they do it, once they wash and cut, they have to get an instructor to approve, and then once they are done styling, they have to get approval again. Very tedious and time consuming.\n\nI have also had underarm wax done here, and wax on my upper lip. They are reasonably priced and quick. Again, instructors are nearby for assistance.\n\nI haven't ever gotten too bad of a haircut here. The main reason for only 3 stars is the anxiety radiating from some of the students. They do tend to play around with each other more than focus on what they are doing. For example, the last time I was here, one student came up to the one who was doing my hair and asked for money. The gal doing my hair said she had no money, and after a few minutes of the other gal just staring at the mirror, my gal had to ask her to leave. Another student told my student to check her face. So, there are little things like that. Maybe professional behavior should also be taught here. What do I know?\n\nRemember not to get too attached to a single person, this is a school, and the hope is that they will graduate and go get jobs else where. The anxiety that radiates some of these students will make them seem unfriendly when they just aren't sure how to be comfortable themselves, and that can make the customer uncomfortable, which can be a bad thing. Again, some sort of training can help them with this. Price is a major factor, and in my opinion, this is worlds above a chain hair style place that is cheap, but the beautician probably is not as well trained, so let that be a point of consideration. These students do have the potential. They did save my hair from worse results. I have not tried coloring services here, and I probably would not.

I've definitely used a lot more electricity and paid a lot less for it in other places but I'm thankful I can buy the gas and electricity to keep my things running.

The spa was mostly white, very nicely decorated. Robes provided were very comfortable. We got the couples mudslide and a couples massage. I honestly didn't want it to end. \n\nThe mudslide was an experience. We hadn't experienced anything like that before. First you put mud that is made with their warm mineral water and essential oils of your choice. You put it on each other in a sauna room and lay there until it bakes on your skin. Then you rinse it off. You then move into a mineral bath room. Nice large tubs-we were actually able to get into a tub together which was nice. They also give you a salt scrub which is really nice for your skin. Then after that you go into the relation zero gravity chairs and meditate. Make sure you are comfortable with the column level. I wish I would have turned my down a bit. But it was all very relaxing. \n\nThe couples massage was amazing.

They had less than 10 reviews at the time but all of them were 5 stars. This place is also located close to my home which is another reason I decided to take my car here. My car was having multiple issues, nothing major. The manager of the shop gave me suggested options to fix my issues. I felt he was honest with me and told me what was a necessary fix and what other fixes could be postponed for the time being. Honesty in a mechanic is hard to find. I was expecting to leave that place spending close to 500 dollars but it turned out I only had to spend 110 at the time. \nAnother instance, I thought my car had an oil leak, I swung it in a Jiffy Lube real quick to see if there was a leak. Turns out I didn't but Jiffy suggested I get new oil pan due to mine being rusty. I walked away from Jiffy with only their advice and took my car into National Auto Sales. After the mechanic took a look, he said the oil pan was a tad rusty but it was not necessary to change it at the moment. Saving me more money. A lot of mechanics everywhere you go seem to suggest other repairs than what you initially brought your car in for. I feel the people at National Auto Service, gives you their honest opinion on the condition of your car which is why I will continue to take my vehicle there every time.\n\n\nThis my first Yelp review btw!

So Deke himself came out of the kitchen, apologized, and gave us a huge tasting plate of whatever they had left (which was pretty much everything on the menu).  I'd say the best thing on the menu are the spare ribs.  I know most people go for the more traditionally tender baby backs, but the spares have so much more flavor and they cook them so perfectly that the tenderness isn't even an issue.  used them to cater my boyfriend's birthday party and they did a fantastic job.  Their prices, especially for the catering packages, are extremely fair.  This is a must try for any BBQ lover!","categories":["Restaurants","Barbeque","Nightlife","Bars"]}

I had three stylists I narrowed it down to but Kat was the most welcoming and seemed most creative. I ended up going to her and she's honestly just amazing and so so so passionate and dedicated. I decided last minute that i wanted to color my hair too (after my hair cut in the morning) and she accomodated me - working up until 10pm (without dinner) inspite of having an early morning flight herself just because I really wanted a perfect look for a big event the next day. I was also unsure of what I had in mind exactly and kept insiting I wanted something \"subtle\" but fun and she picked up on it super quick. I absolutely LOVE my hair. It was a really good experience for me. Kat takes her work really seriously and is really talented\/hardworking - it definitely doesnt hurt that she's really sweet too.

We didn't have reservations and the wait to sit inside was 45 mins to an hour! So, I would definitely recommend making a reservation. Luckily, it was only the two of us and there was no wait to sit out on the patio. So, we missed the movie clips\/whatever they have going on inside, but the rooftop patio was awesome! It was really nice and offered a great view. \n\nThe complimentary bread comes with some dip with oil and cheese in it. Both amazing! I wasn't in the mood for drink drinks, but I got the raspberry lemonade, which was great and bottomless. My fiance got the buffalo Caribbean chicken tenders and a side caesar salad which he said was \"good, but not amazing\". I had the sirloin tips which I loved. The sirloin tips were over mashed potatoes and spinach with balsamic vinaigrette, it was perfect. Our waitress  was great and attentive. The prices are reasonable and portion sizes were good. I have also since tried their pizza which is really good. I will definitely be back to try more items on the menu.

{"stars":4,"text":"The Mother Church of Country is a musical institution in Nashville that is unrivaled in beauty & soul.  Originally built for the Union Gospel Tabernacle, the Ryman eventually became well known for the live Grand Ole Opry shows and radio broadcasts.  Even if you are not a fan of country music, you will be hard pressed not to be inspired by the historic significance of the Ryman. So many talented musicians have been proud to step foot into the circle - My first show at the Ryman was Sturgill Simpson and I will never forget how excited I was to finally be living in Tennessee.  Some of my favorite bands have played there and it is always an amazing experience.  My favorite shows have been - The Wild Feathers, Jamestown Revival, The Head & the Heart, Jason Isbell, Margo Price, Tyler Childers, Lucas Nelson, and Lucinda Williams. I'm so excited to see Josh Ritter tonight and Ray LaMontagne in October!  Honestly the only show I was disappointed by was the Vince Gill Christmas Show.  Otherwise I highly recommend seeing your favorite band or trying someone new! I would like it if ushers (and some concert goers) would not talk so loud during performances.  Sometimes the sound can vary in quality but usually is very good. I saw the I'm with Her acoustic show and would like to see more of that style...The valet parking is hit or miss- I wish you could reserve a spot in advance because if it is full then it can take 10-30 minutes more to find a parking spot (there is a garage right next door but sometimes with traffic it can be a long wait to exit). I would just recommend being careful when purchasing tickets because some seats have restricted views or are tighter on actual seat space.  And of course sitting above is a much different experience than sitting below (you just have to try both to figure out what you prefer) Tickets can sell out quickly so I recommend getting the email or FB alerts to see when new shows are added.  I wish they would allow refillable water bottles - they do not recycle or compost!

There is a large lounge area that's great for waiting for friends or a show time.

The theaters have very comfortable reclining seats that even allow for room to comfortably walk by when the seats are fully reclined.  No climbing over anyone here! The theater offers options to see movies in XD, 3D or your standard viewings, which is great.  The audio in XD is excellent as well!  I also enjoy being able to pick my seats in advance.  I've honestly never had a problem here and only have good things to say.  I would say it's likely the best movie theater nearby.

{"stars":5,"text":"I really like coming to this Stout's Footwear (formerly New Balance) store.  I have learned so much and found the staff to be very helpful.  Here's some reasons why:\n1.  I assumed my feet stayed the same size.  They measured my feet and because they had flattened over time, I went from wearing a size 10 1\/2 to a 12.  Talk about improving my comfort!\n\n2.  I had intentionally bought shoes a little small because I have those type of heels that shoes  slide off the back.  When I mentioned it, they showed me how to tie the Runner's Tie on my athletic shoes and eliminated the problem.\n\n3.  I used to run a lot, but switched to walking to ease stress on my old bones.  I assumed I needed a walking shoe.  But when I talked about the quantity of steps I was taking, they directed me back to something closer to a running shoe support which made a big difference in my comfort.\n\n4.  I used to buy shoes when they started to look worn on the outside, never really thinking about the inside.  When I was suffering from arch pain, they taught me that every day shoes wear out faster on the inside where the arch support is needed.  So, ever since I started buying new shoes every six months (regardless of how good they may have looked on the outside), I have not had any arch pain or ankle pain where my old running fracture had been.  I mark the 6 months on my calendar to remind me.  Being pain free is worth the cost of a pair of new shoes.\n\nSure, the New Balance line is on the expensive side for someone like me who is retired, but they tend to have special sales and\/or coupons for discounts if you watch for them.  \n\nGone are the days when new shoes had to be \"broken in\" to feel right.  Now, I wear my new shoes right out of the store. \n\nReview #637","categories":["Shoe Stores","Fashion","Local Services","Shoe Repair","Shopping"]}

We ordered 3 bagels with cream cheese, a cinnamon roll to split, and 3 drinks (hot cocoa, chai latte, and an Americano). The price was very reasonable and we paid about $20 for everything. We sat outside in the courtyard because the inside of the shop smelled very strongly of cleaning supplies. The outdoor area also smelled faintly of cleaning supplies, but it wasn't bad. The outdoor area was pretty and clean. I saw another table being served with a delicious looking bagel platter that had vegetables arranged with sprouts and avocado (I'm definitely getting that next time!).

I went to get everything and one of the employees noticed I was struggling to carry everything and helped me take everything to our table. \nWe all loved the food (the bagels tasted so fresh!), and I loved my Americano.

I had reservations for a party of four and when we arrived we were seated after just a few minutes. So first of all, as far as the ambience goes it's more of a dark\/dim restaurant. It can be casual enough for a few friends to go out or you can make it fancy enough for a special date. \n\nAfter being seated we literally had at least three waiters, possibly more I lost track. The service was on par actually above and beyond. They were there to refill our glasses before we could even look up. I've dined at plenty of different restaurants all over, however this place will rank within the top 3 restaurants I've ever been to.\n\nThe food itself was incredible. Our party ordered a few different things that we shared, one of which was this large wood style cutting board that came loaded with fried chicken, andouille sausage, crawfish, and mixed vegetables. Let me say this is the best fried chicken I've ever had, EVER! It's odd to go to such a fancy restaurant and be impressed by fried chicken, but this fried chicken was out of this world. Perfectly seasoned, fried just enough, juicy, tender, just perfect! We also ordered gumbo soup which was amazing, a corn something soup which was also amazing, and an angel hair pasta with cream sauce - which was just ok. \n\nOverall this restaurant has incredible service, delicious food, a great ambience, and is a MUST if you are in the area.

Now it could be exaggerated by the fact that I had just walked out of Kentwood Ford after telling them where they could respectfully place their pressure 'sales' techniques (and by respectfully place I may or may not mean shove it!!).\n\nI walked in knowing exactly what I wanted and exactly what I wanted to pay for it.  And I walked out with just that - exactly what I wanted for exactly what I wanted to pay - is this real life???  They were straight forward and did everything they could to track down my dream car (which turns out was in BC).  Made sure that I got every deal available (winter tires and rims, a way more than wicked deal on my crappy trade in, and they even gave my dad a referral bonus even though he had only talked to this sales guy once before but had not purchased anything which is typically how the program works).  \n\nBy the way the referral program is actually not bad - not like 'go-auto' who gives you $500 bucks towards services they offer at their locations - $750.00 (minimum) cash to do whatever you see fit with - like an actual incentive, not \"here's $500 bucks that you can give right back to me when I perform overpriced services on your car in my shops only...blah blah blah.\"\n\nIn general, I found Rob (the sales guy) and Ashley (the finance lady) to be respectful, straight forward, and fair.

( 3 out of 4 times he had answered the service department phone ) \n\nHe tells the truth and do not try and make up some items that don't need to be replaced.  Bill is a great guy.\n\nThank you Crown Buick for employing him. \n\nUpdate \n3\/12\/18\n\nMy service representative Bill Hevel is the best!

My daughter and I had the prime rib and it was superb--cooked perfectly and a high quality cut of meat.  \n\nThis is not an ultra high quality steakhouse like Mortons but it's the next level down.

They load the sandwiches up with tremendous amounts of meat. \n\nMake sure if you order large amounts of food to order a head of time.  They only have 2 people working usually, so big orders might slow them down a little when they are busy.\n\nOverall this place rocks for a quick sandwich for lunch.  \n\nThe only problems I see with this place is that they are closed on Mondays and they don't open till 11 every day after. \n\nOver all this place is awesome and staff is extremely nice.  I recommend this place to anyone who like hoagies and cheesesteaks.\n\nPlease Note:\n\nCheesesteaks are chopped finely.  Much different from a Pats and Geno's steak. Also much different from a normal cheesesteak that is chopped up. You might have to order extra cheese with your sandwich.

If you are doing family-style, do yourself a favor and get the Salt & Pepper Oysters if they are on the specials menu.

Yep, this is also your place. It's $6.95 for a HUGE plate of food. I usually opt for the Mongolian Beef lunch special with the pork fried rice, which also comes with a spring roll and soup. \n\nThe customer service is good.

Shaya is a bounty full of great dishes served in the perfect venue with service that is beyond compare than any major restaurant in the city including Commanders Palace. The decor is perfectly simple and bistro like with muted lighting that gives you the feeling you are about to have an amazing experience and surely you are.  Shaya is a place you want to visit with a group of four and just go around the menu trying as many of the awesome dishes that you can afford. I am not going to give you a item by item review because I don't know what most of what I had is but all of it was fantastic. What made the service so great is that everything was served family style course by course. We ordered everything at the beginning of the meal and as the evening went on we kept getting delicious small plates and dishes for a full three hours long. What also amazed me was that as much as I like meat and am a carnivore we only had one meat dish and didn't miss a beat. This place is no 1000 figs its 1000 times better. Eating at Shaya is such a treat with an unexpected level of service that will blow your mind. Its easy to see why Shaya has a James Bear award or two on the wall. We will be back when we get a table in 6 months to try the other dishes on the menu. The only small drawback is that Yelp has it as a $$ venue when its actually $$$.

We chose the flat crust and it was very nice: crispy with a softer inside. Overall, the pizza was not \"sloppy and greasy\" either. The chicken wings were well cooked and had a nice amount out meat on the bones. As we ate, we watched an interestingly entertaining Issac Newton documentary on their wall-mounted flat screen TV.

The tofu pieces were largely cut, grilled, and topped with a with a pineapple salsa. It came with asparagus and green beans accompanied with a small mound of mango sticky rice and below a coconut curry sauce. The dish was very tasty but wish it came with a little more curry sauce as tofu is quite bland on its own.

We have the largest green space\/park space of any city in North America!  Yeah, that's right!  I'm for real!  Don't believe me?  Check it out:  http:\/\/www.edmonton.ca\/living.asp.\n\nSpeaking of Festivals, how about our freaking amazing Folk Festival held every summer?  Our Folk Fest is one of a kind and people travel from all over the country to come enjoy our amazing festivals!  Here are a few of my have:  \n\nhttp:\/\/www.edmontonfolkfest.org\nhttp:\/\/www.cariwest.ca\nhttp:\/\/www.bluesinternationalltd.com\nhttp:\/\/www.iceonwhyte.ca\nhttps:\/\/www.fringetheatre.ca\/festival.php\n\nThe music scene here is alive and kicking from blues to country to folk to hip hop!  We've got it all.  And why not throw in some drama by taking in an opera at the Edmonton Opera located in the fabulous Jubiliee Auditorium:  http:\/\/www.edmontonopera.com\n\nAnd just a 15 minute drive north of Edmonton is the St. Albert International Children's Festival held every year!  http:\/\/www.childfest.com\n\nAnd there are soooo many  more... Pretty much every week during the summer has a festival or event or two or three!  And don't forget our Food Truck culture is coming alive here with Food Truck nights coupled with Outdoor and Indoor Farmer's Markets full of fresh and local goodness!\n\nFor a pretty complete listing of current and upcoming festivals, check out:  http:\/\/exploreedmonton.com\/festivals-and-events\/summer\n\nWe have the fabulous North Saskatchewan River Valley & Parks system that allows you to explore our city from one end to the other by trail or water!  http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/North_Saskatchewan_River_valley_parks_system\n\nWe kick a$$ at recycling and our landfill system is state of the art - I mean they sort through EVERYTHING even taking apart diapers to breakdown what can be recylced\/composted\/or trashed!  You don't have to sort your recycles either - just throw them out in a blue bag and the fabulous waste management and recycling team does the rest!\n\nWe have phenomenal parks (playgrounds and spray parks that are FREE) and world class leisure centres!  I can tell you that growing up in Seattle, I didn't have access to a dozen swimming pools including things like wave pools, salt water, and crazy awesome kiddo\/toddler sections!  \n\nThere is a vibrant food scene with many chefs and restaurants focusing on local and sustainable options!\n\nCalgary definitely has one up on us with mountains in their backyard but we do have ski hills in town!  Where else can you go skiing for a few hours without having to pay for a hotel or drive home exhausted and risk falling asleep!\n\nAnd of course, let's not forget the attractions that we are known around the world for:\n\nWest Edmonton Mall complete with bowling alley, water park, amusement ride park, movie theatre, comedy club, dinner theatre, and more!  http:\/\/www.wem.ca\n\nThe Muttart Conservatory - A spectacular series of glass pyramids home to flora and fauna from all over the world!  http:\/\/www.edmonton.ca\/attractions_events\/muttart-conservatory.aspx\n\nAnd don't forget the Telus World of Science chock full of awesomeness from the planetarium, to iMax, to rotating exhibits as well as regular ones!

Of course there are!  Roads and construction are definitely an ongoing issue but we're making strides in this department as well (like the upcoming completion of the Anthony Henday - a ring road around our entire city).\n\nOur crime rates are not among the best or safest in the country as a \"whole\" as pointed out by the other reviewer but we have outstanding communities and many areas of the city coming together working to revitalize what was once a \"non desirable\" area such as Alberta Avenue.\n\nThe cost of living here has increased substantially in the 12 years I've been living here - I've seen average house prices double to what I could pay back home in Seattle.  I would like to see improvements in the area of affordable housing and limits put on what feels like extortion for a first time home owner, but I digress :-)\n\nCouple that with fabulous schooling options with U of Alberta, NAIT, Grant MacEwan... the options are endless here!\n\nI firmly believe that anyone can come to Edmonton and follow their dreams!","categories":["Local Flavor","Public Services & Government"]}

They are a little brusque and their English is not the best so patience is required but that is not out of the ordinary for salons. What I enjoyed so much was that the lady doing my daughters nails saw that she was sensitive and jumpy and would give a little warning before she started a new nail and countdown how many more their were to go etc and when my child jumped back she had enough control of what she was doing not to cut herself or my child.

{"stars":5,"text":"Great food, Great Service, and Great Drinks...Total Win!!!\n\nOur waitress, Sunny, was great. Ask for her when you arrive. Great personality.\n\nThe decor is old-school. I love the unique black & white photos decorating the walls. The photos are of famous people, but with tattoos. I've never seen these types of photos. Seriously, Barbara Streisand with ink?...Pretty awesome!!! Kudos to the imagination that came up with the idea of using of these photos.\n\nAhhhh...but the food. The entire menu is a creative mix of traditional food turned into a slightly new version. For example, yes, they have hot dogs...but, the \"normal\", simplest version of their hot dog is:\n\n     1\/4 lb all beef hot dogs are bacon wrapped and deep fried\n\nHow can you go wrong with this? The entire menu is really clever. I even liked their \"Willy Dynamite\" Mac & Cheese...and I am not a Mac & Cheese fanatic. This is what I had:\n\nHarlem Sunset: Highly recommended. Delicious.\n\nSignature Popcorn with Truffle and Citrus: Addicting. Great with drinks. Large portion. My popcorn was not salted, which would normally be disappointing. But, there  was so much flavor, that it does not really need any. The occasional pop of citrus is a nice surprise. I am so lucky that Dave (my husband) is not too keen about popcorn.\n\nThe Willy Dynamite: Yummy!! Large Portion. Your tastebuds do the \"Happy Dance\" when tasting the BBQ sauce, gouda cheese, pasta, and the butcher block bacon...then, you find the moist pulled chicken that's been hiding under all of the macaroni. Really good.\n\nWe can't wait for the Movie Theatre to be opened. The owner, Rich, told Dave that they will be showing movies like \"Spaceballs\". OMG!!!!!\n\nGigglewaters is a great restaurant.

Very tender, light smoke, drizzle it with either Texas Hot or St. Louis style sauce. \n\nPulled Pork 10 out of 10. Moist and full of smokey goodness. \n\nBrisket 8 out of 10. The flavor was there, it was just over cooked. We did get there around 3:30 pm (try to get there around 1-2) so maybe it was under a warmer for a while. But still went down easy with any of the sauces provided. \n\nRibs 7 out of 10. They were hard to separate and I'm a big guy. The dry rub was full of flavor but the meat was still a little tuff. \n\nSausage. (With jalape\u00f1o) wow! 11 out of 10. I've never said a meat was creamy, but this sausage was just that. Had some back end heat to keep that flavor around. \n\nThe sides. Oh my god! They were huge! And you can add Cole slaw to any meal for 1$... DO IT. The brisket chilli and potato salad is what I went with. Added Cole slaw and Mac and cheese. All of the sides we fantastic. \n\nThe staff SUPER NICE!

{"stars":5,"text":"Can't say I am much of a fan of riding my bike on gravel.  It has always been something that I struggled with more than enjoyed.  However, I love this trail for all that it's worth.  \n\nThe trail is enormously long and you can either bike the flatter parts near old town St. Charles or really go for it and ride it all they way out to Herman.  The scenery on this trail is amazing.  You are biking along the Missouri River and the views are just gorgeous.   If you are biking through wine country, it's very popular to stop along the wineries along the way.  I must warn you, this seems like a better idea when you are doing it than when you have to bike back to your origin.  I suggest parking a car at the end of your trail and then piling in that car with your bikes to get to the car at your point of origin (with a designated driver of course).  \n\nIt's great to bike or to walk, and if you don't own a bike, you can rent them easily from a store in Old Town St. Charles (or if you don't want to tear your bike up driving all the way there or on the gravel, this might be a good move anyway).  \n\nBeautiful, historic, and a decent work out.  Even though gravel eats up my tires, I love the Katy Trail.","categories":["Active Life","Parks","Hiking"]}

Right from our first contact with them at Bridal Fantasy, Ryan (Owner) and Teresa (Coordinator) were extremely hands on. Their attention to detail, constant follow-up, and confidence in their product really reassured us that we made the right choice for our equipment rental, DJ entertainment, and hall decorating needs.\n\nWe rented a Bose sound system for our ceremony, and despite its compact and deceiving size, it really pumped out a lot of sound. It was perfect for our wedding, and alongside the iPod (that was loaded with a playlist of our ceremony songs), extra cords, and a microphone that were included in the rental, it really made our ceremony just that much more special!\n\nOur reception was made perfect through our DJ, Ryan. Not only did he set up our uplighting around the hall, but he provided MC services for our wedding and did an amazing job providing the entertainment. He had everyone engaged and dancing from the first song he played, and really read our crowd well. He consistently checked in with us throughout the night to make sure everything was on schedule and going to plan, and was very resilient and adaptable when it came to changes in our programme (i.e., games, speeches, cake cutting, etc). He even saved us the trip back to Revolution the next day by taking our equipment rental back for us!\n\nAt the end of the day, it is clear to me that Revolution Entertainment really wanted to make our special day perfect. They recommended vendors to us that they have worked with in the past and truly went above and beyond in making sure we would have an amazing wedding.

I mean after all they were free...\n\nSince the hotel is in the middle of renovation, we were were given a room on the 11th floor, which had already been finished. The recent work made the room beautiful! King bed was so comfy! It also had more than enough space in the fullsize fridge and freezer. \n\nThe only thing that was not awesome in the room was the pull out sofa bed. It didn't surprise me, but I have an average pull out that it far more comfortable.\n\nI would say it was a great experience overall at this hotel and this is coming from someone who works at a hotel. \n\nA couple notes and tips:\n\nBourbon street is about a 7 minute walk from the hotel, and there are a few cool looking restaurants on the way. Probably still best to walk in groups. If you are feeling extra lazy, cab there is only $5.50 for 2 people.

{"stars":5,"text":"I've always seen the name and brand for Pizza Factory but never had the product until today. The location I'm writing about opened about 4 months ago. I've been meaning to set foot in the door but always got distracted or just wound up going elsewhere. The inspiration for today's visit was two-fold: \n\n1) My next door neighbor ordered pizza from a chain that's down the street which ignited my craving. \n2) This location happened to be in my Facebook feed offering a deal on a large, one-topping pizza for $9.99.\n\nI was blown away at how spacious it is inside of the room. I never tried the previous restaurant that was here before Pizza Factory so I had no idea how many people could fit inside. The place reminded me of when I was a kid and where we would go after soccer matches. In this day and age of people using food delivery services, may I suggest stepping away from that mind set and setting foot in here. They have a great selection of appetizers, and all you can eat salad bar, a lunch buffet (from 11am-2pm) for $7.99 that features all you can eat salad, breadsticks, and pizza. They also have delicious sandwiches plus, pasta dishes like lasagna, baked spaghetti, ravioli, and more. Their pizza menu is extensive AND they have calzones. I almost forgot to mention their 'beers by the ounce' that are available on taps that YOU can pour from for yourself. They have both local beer and domestics you know well.\n\nIf you're on a budget and have a number of mouths to feed, I strongly advise you to take a moment and check out what they have to offer. The price is right, the food is incredible, and their staff greets you with a smile while working hard to get your food out to you in a timely manner. \n\nIt's safe to say that I'll be back soon whether it's with friends or if I'm flyin' solo. \n\nThanks for taking the time to read this.","categories":["Restaurants","Pizza"]}

{"stars":4,"text":"I've been to Little Fish three times for dinner, and I just recently decided to check out their tasting menu.  I enjoyed it, but I'd honestly rather pay more and end up with more dishes that excite me for a better experience overall.  With the tasting menu of course you can't choose what you get, and the portions are much smaller than the items on the regular one.  The tasting menu is now $38, and comes with five courses, which is comparable to the price of a single entree there (they are usually around $40).  Don't get me wrong, it's a good deal, but if I choose myself, I usually end up with more dishes that wow me and fit my taste preferences.\n\nThe first course was a simple salad.  I felt like it was kind of a filler course to be honest.  It contained baby spinach and a few sliced radishes with an unmemorable vinaigrette.  The second course was superb and interesting.  It was two small slices of opah.  The fish was light but flavorful and served with a creamy yogurt, crispy almonds, greens, and sweet pineapple.  The flavor\/texture combination was lovely.\n\nThe next course was disappointing.  It was a small piece of swordfish over a bed of potato hash.  I had it without the bacon, so maybe it was better with that if you like pork, but I felt that it was boring and didn't really have interesting flavors going on.  My husband had it with the bacon and wasn't impressed either.  \n\nThe main course was amazing.  It was striped bass over a bed of black lentils with a spring onion puree.  The puree was so fresh tasting and savory. I scraped every last drop of that sauce off my plate with my fork.  I think I could have drank it if they served it up in a bowl.  The lentils were tender, but not too soft, and the fish was fresh and delicious.  \n\nThe desserts at Little Fish usually don't impress me as much as the savory dishes do, but this was a different case on that evening.  We were served an olive oil cake with a pistachio sauce.  Wow!  The cake with light and fluffy like angel food and the sauce was creamy and full of pistachio goodness. If you ever see that on the menu there, get it!\n\n A little info for picky eaters:  The main reason I'd put off doing the tasting menu here, was that I don't eat pork, and Little Fish tends to incorporate it into quite a few of their dishes on their daily changing menu.  I was craving seafood on a Sunday night and saw tables open on Open Table, so I called the restaurant to ask what the offering was for the set menu.  Everything was pork free except for one dish.  They told me they could leave out an ingredient no problem, but no substitutions were allowed.  I was happy with that answer, especially because the dish with the pork was not a main course anyway.  Just call ahead before you come, and if it's just one ingredient like that, they'll probably be willing to work with you.","categories":["Seafood","Restaurants"]}

It took a little longer for them to clear the theater from the previous movie so we had to sit outside and not be tempted to eat all our movie snacks. The cleaning crew did a decent job cleaning up but every other showing or so they should try to wipe down the seats with a towel, because yeah, sometimes spills happen from before and no one wants to sit in that for 2+ hours. In any case, we found someone to help with that. Sound system was great, most seAts are pretty good and popcorn was okay but not as warm and toasty as I normally like it to be.

I love Peruvian cuisine first and foremost, but the dishes at Mango seem to have a bit more flair without going overboard and still staying true to the heart and soul of Peruvian food.\n\nThe atmosphere is fantastic - this restaurant just feels like a place you would take someone for a date that was special. The drinks are amazing, particularly the Pisco Sour. The Ceviche mixto is fantastic - great seafood choices and worth a try on any visit.\n\nAmazing food, amazing atmosphere, great service, and overall a wonderful experience every visit.

{"stars":4,"text":"Au Bon Climat is well known for their more reserved style of winemaking. It's not very common to find this style here in California, but they definitely do it incredibly well. If you're looking for something more fruit-forward, I'd suggest looking elsewhere.\n\nAt the time of writing, they have two flights to choose from: the classic flight, and the reserve flight. I'd suggest the classic flight if you want to try a variety of styles, and the reserve flight if you came to Santa Barbara for Pinot Noir. I had the reserve flight.\n\nSeveral of the wines completely blew me away. The Chardonnay in particular was absolutely amazing. I'd say they definitely live up to their name.\n\nI highly suggest coming to visit this winery if you get the chance, but I'd also suggest doing a bit of homework before coming here so you can fully appreciate it.\n\nYou get the tasting fee waived with a $60 purchase. I opted not to buy anything as I was traveling and could only carry so many wine bottles. You can find Au Bon Climat almost anywhere.","categories":["Wine Tasting Room","Food","Arts & Entertainment","Wineries"]}

{"stars":5,"text":"As a person that often drives from DC to NJ and vice versa, I prefer this rest stop to the Chesapeake House, the Maryland House, or any of the older rest stops in Jersey. There are plenty of rest rooms, several food options, and two methods of Starbucks. Please keep in mind that this place is often crowded. Whether it be a travel bus, sports team, or family vacation, this place is ALWAYS packed. However, it's the best rest stop on this highway journey so I can't blame everyone for having the same thoughts and choosing this location. \n\nFood Options:\nAuntie Anne's\/Carvel - average \n\nBurger King - serves Whoppers during morning breakfast hours! Also seems to have kiosks for ordering to beat the line, but I haven't personally used this technology.\n\nPopeyes - LOVE this option. It's the only Popeyes on the drive. Jersey rest stops have Roy Rogers and Maryland rest stops have Wendy's and Pizza Hut. Popeyes at a rest stop is a wonderful concept! \n\nPanda Express - this is where the pizza place used to be. Frankly, I never saw anyone get pizza from here. The crowds always flock to Burger King and Popeyes. Kudos to management for seeing that it wasn't doing well and changing it to a more popular restaurant choice.\n\nBaja Fresh - limited menu than a regular Baja Fresh. However, it still fulfills your taco needs. It's the \"healthier option\" of the other food court choices.\n\nThe Cafe - this section is currently closed off and under construction. The pizza place turned into a Panda Express. I wonder what this will turn into?!?!?\n\nStarbucks - there is a stand in the middle of the plaza and there is also a stand alone building. All locations are always busy. Solid Starbucks locations.\n\nThere is also a convenience store for beverages, snacks, daily essentials. Opposite the convenience store is a souvenir shop with Delaware items. Always plenty of seating for everyone inside and out. Parking lot is massive with lots of spots. It's a large plaza with lots of space for everyone to spread out. \n\nThe gas station that is attached is also convenient.

But definitely upscale--come dressed well! I have spent much time in New Orleans and have eaten at all the top spots, and I gotta say that despite my skepticism when looking at the menu (I'm not a fan of mustard or pickled things, both of which there were lots of) I rank this among the city's very, very best.

Figured I would walk in to the bar, place my order, get my food, and leave. I ended up making a pretty custom salad just because of what I was feeling at the moment, and the guy who took my order (Ryan) was extremely accommodating, friendly, and over all made the little bit of time I was sitting here super easy and comfortable. He asked if I wanted anything to drink while I waited, if he could bring me bread or anything (both of which I declined) but you could tell he wanted to make my wait enjoyable. He was only covering bar for someone else for a brief period of time, but when the actual bartender (Lexi) came back and my food came out, she checked the box before giving it to me, noticed something missing after checking my receipt (when she didn't even take the order) and immediately said \"hold on let me go back to the kitchen, they forgot something.\" The fact that my order was so off the wall honestly I'm not surprised something minor was missed by the kitchen (no biggie at all) and my entire over all wait time was short. The manager even came and apologized!! I never leave reviews but it's the little things that stand out to me and this place seems great, plus my salad was delicious!","categories":["Food","American (New)","Sandwiches","Restaurants","Desserts","Bars","Steakhouses","American (Traditional)","Wine Bars","Nightlife","Seafood"]}

{"stars":5,"text":"Overall, OrderQD gets 5 stars! I've now gotten take out twice and I will highlight each item we have tried. \nOne of the reasons I decided to try this new restaurant is because of the thoughtful responses by the business owner, Dave R. To the reviews... good and bad. So nice to see the owner explain the process of how it all works! \n\nORDERING\/PICK-UP:\nUsing the app to order is a breeze and I really love it! The only issue I've had is I couldn't get Apple Pay to work when paying for my order. It it may just be a glitch but I thought I'd mention it. You can still add in your credit card and pay with no problem. AND right now if you download their app and use code GOTYOURAPP (Got Your App) as a promotion code, you get $20 off your order! What?!?! Great deal! . \n\nTO-GO: \nItems are packaged really well! Bags are sealed. If you get plasticwear, there's a 25 cent charge. You can request items be deconstructed which is cool if you know it's going to be just a bit before you get to dig in! They charge $1 extra to deconstruct. No b*tching.., it costs them more to use the extra packaging! $1 is fair! \n\nCOVID PRECAUTIONS: \nEmployees had on masks, all bags sealed. \n\nFOOD: \nQD Pie: 10 out of 10\nMy fave! The perfectly cooked crust wraps around the single serve pie tin. Buttery, Smooth, yet crisp and golden brown. The pot pie is fully enveloped in crust including the bottom in the tin! The chicken, creamy sauce, and veggies inside are just as delicious! \n\nThe OG Chicken Sandwich: 8 out of 10\nThe chicken is top notch! Juicy and cooked just right! Toasted, buttered bun is perfect. I added bacon which was delicious! I also added lettuce, tomato, and Mayo instead of the special sauce. My biggest issue is with the pickles. I got them on the side. I'm very serious about my pickle preferences. Lol \nI can assure you that these are very fine, quality pickles but they are sweet... No... I'm sad! If you like a sweet\/bread and butter pickle, you'll no doubt love these but I only want sour pickles, so they aren't for me. \n\nBling Burger: 8 out of 10\nCooked well and juicy. Big burger! The bacon was mighty fine! \nWe couldn't taste the truffle aioli. My boyfriend says it needed more cheese. He is a bit obsessed with cheese, so keep that in mind. I'll add here that the burgers are a few dollars more than you'd pay at a fast food place but they are sooooo much better! Fresh, quality ingredients. \n\nBY\u00f6B B\u00f6l: Large size: 9 out of 10\nThis is huge! Definitely enough for two meals! I could have done a work out using this bowl! \nI messed up and learned a lesson. I couldn't decide if I wanted rice and beans or quinoa so I got those 2 for my bases. Wow, that's a heavy, filling bowl! They don't skimp on the servings. Next time, I'll get lettuce or cabbage with one or the other grains. If you want to be full, get this bowl! The ingredients are so fresh and yummy. Roasted squash and Brussels are delicious! \n\nChicken Tenders: 8 out of 10\nlike pickles, I am especially picky about my chicken tenders. When I first opened these up, I was a little disappointed. They looked small for the price but as any real fan of tenders knows, it depends on the breading, right?! Many tenders that look huge are half breading with a little chicken. After tasting, I realized these tenders were juicy, cooked well, and had a nice, seasoned flavor with just enough breading. It was mostly chicken! \n\nSides: \n\nRice & Beans. 9\/10 Good flavor! \n\nMac & cheese 8\/10 Love the spiraled pasta. Super cheesy. A tad sweet maybe with the creamier cheese. \n\nColeslaw: 7\/10 Fresh and crisp. Not a fan of mayonnaise based\/sweeter slaws, so more a personal preference. \n\nBrussels, Broccoli, Bacon Char: 9\/10. Yummy! \nAll sides were healthy portions. They pack the to-go container full! \n\nDesserts: (Yes!)\n\nFudge Brownie: 9\/10. Yummy! I was able to make this 2 portions. Large and super chocolate flavor! The extras on top just add to the deliciousness! \n\nPeachy Keen Bread Pudding: 9\/10\nMy boyfriend's favorite. Big portion! Definitely better warm. Yummy! \n\nChurros: 7\/10 \nThese are good but a little dense for in texture. In my opinion they should be a bit fluffier\/lighter on the inside of the crisp outside of the churro. Still tasty and you get a nice portion with 3 dipping sauces (whip cream, chocolate, caramel). \n\nS'mores cake: 4\/10 \nI'm really sad about this one because I think this could be yummy but it was over cooked and the bottom was so burned that it was black\/charred. I was able to eat off the top and the parts that weren't burned were really good. I think I'd need to try it again before giving a real opinion. Based on the flavor that came from what wasn't burned, I'd try it again. \nThis was the only mistake I saw from the folks at OrderQD. I'm sure it can happen. \n\nWe will DEFINITELY be eating more from OrderQD!","categories":["Burgers","Chicken Wings","Restaurants","Chicken Shop","Food Delivery Services","Food","Sandwiches"]}

{"stars":4,"text":"I went to Acucare for the 1st time based on the Yelp reviews. I got a 30 min Acupressure session and a 30 min Reflexology session. I believe it was the owner that assigned a nice woman to me who didn't speak English, so she informed her of the services I wanted.  We started with the Acupressure first.  It was GREAT! She had nice strong hands and I dozed off pretty easily.  However, I was jarred awake and startled several times with a banging noise that was coming from upstairs.  I am not sure what was going on, but it was like someone was hammering over and over. So, it truly did interrupt my overall experience.  Then at one point, I could hear loud talking outside the room I was in.  In such a place like that, voices should be kept at a whisper so not to disturb the sessions taking place.\n\nAfter my Acupressure session, the lady had me flip over onto my back to get in position for Reflexology.  When I turned over, she had turned the light up bright, which felt a bit disruptive, then turned it back down again to start the Reflexology.  Once again, the massage was great and I fell asleep with ease, but kept being jarred awake with the constant banging from upstairs.  So, it was a bit hard to stay relaxed with that happening.  And when she was done, she turned the light up bright again, which is not the most comfortable  way to come out of a massage.\n\n Overall, the massages were great.  I would definitely give them another try.  Hopefully the sound is under control.","categories":["Beauty & Spas","Massage","Acupuncture","Health & Medical"]}

The parking was a bit of a fiasco, but I suppose that's to be expected.  \n\nWe walked right up to the Will Call, collected our tickets and headed to the club level.  On the way in we were stopped by some bud light promo folks who gave everyone free passes to go into their little hut  thingy and enjoy 3 free beers!

Wasn't very far from our seats!  There could be a few more tables\/seating areas inside though.  I can't complain too much because we were able to nab a table fairly quickly.

I came here looking for a no-nonsense haircut without the hype many other New Orleans barber shops (read: beauty salons for men) have. The original owner, Pat O'Connell, welcomed me to the shop and cut my hair himself. There are three chairs in the shop, but he was the only barber in that day. Pat has a great story to tell, and the history of the shop is equally fascinating. Since it was a slow afternoon, I stayed for an extra 20 minutes to chat after my haircut.\n\nHere is the vital information:\n- A normal haircut is $20 (includes shaving the nape of your neck and sideburns).\n- Cash and check only, no credit cards.\n- He does do REAL straight razor shaves unlike most other shops.\nOpen until 5:00 weekdays and Saturday (not sure about Sunday).\n- Make an appointment.\n- No smoking.\n- Parking is on street, but you can find parking a couple blocks away around Dauphine Street.

They're interested in full body awareness and mental relaxation while moving the body through specific stretches and exercises to promote strength, flexibility and coordination.","categories":["Massage Therapy","Health & Medical","Active Life","Fitness & Instruction","Yoga","Reiki","Meditation Centers"]}

{"stars":5,"text":"Cyndi and Michelle helped me with my experience in a private shop! I had called in and described my wants to Cyndi who explained \"We have just what you're looking for!\". The sign outside the shop said \"Welcome Jacquelyne\" which was a nice touch. They pulled out all the stops and offered me wine or water right off the bat. They took some time to hear my wants and get a feel for my style and then they selected some dresses for me to try on. They also let me look around and pick any to try on that I wanted to. I literally didn't select any other dresses than the ones they chose for me. I was between two perfect gorgeous dresses and they ease my worry and helped me chose the dress that was most flattering and had all my wants and needs in one dress! They made me fee comfortable and important and I would recommend them to any bride looking for a modern, sexy, but still bridal gown! I had looked at so many places prior and nothing had captured my essence until going to Bridal's by Cyndi! My dress has everything on my checklist and I couldn't be happier! When I knew it was the one we popped some champagne in celebration, signed some papers, I put a deposit down and they even gave me a very appropriate cute gift and folder with all my papers. It truly was a one-on-one experience that I will cherish forever! Thanks Cyndi and Michelle for treating me like a princess\/celebrity! You guys are the best!","categories":["Shopping","Bridal"]}

The employee manning the register was very helpful. I scoped out the meat department and was amazed at the offerings. Cuts of meat that I was not familiar with, organ meats, chicken breasts, all very neatly displayed in the tightly packed display case. The guy behind the counter didn't seem to mind my asking a few questions. All the employees were constantly busy with different tasks as I went back to the grill and ordered some tacos,  two lengua and two cabeza. The kitchen looked to be very clean and organized. While these were being prepared I had a look at the produce section. Tomaillos, nopales, tuna (not a fish!), nothing looked past its prime. Then my tacos were ready. Comedy time... the booths were like desks out of an elementary school, I could barely squeeze myself in. The meat in the tacos was extremely tender and moist, and well seasoned. Wedges of lime and radish slices on the side. On the way out I bought some spices and chili coated dried fruits.

Hoosband and I stopped here after our trip to Valenzano Winery at around 3 pm on a Friday. When we walked in there was no one at the host area. We waited there a good 3 minutes before someone came, and they only came because they telephone rang.\n\nWhen we were seated the waitress came over immediately, greeted us and took drink orders. Being that we had just left the winery I opted out of alcoholic beverages, but my husband did not. I can't remember what the name of his drink was, but it was pink\/purple, fruity and refreshing. Of course I had to taste it.\n\nFor an app we had the mussels in white sauce. Holy cow were they good, aside from the two that I had which were a little sandy. For a meal I had the shrimp di fielo - or something like that, lol. So tasty! It was made with homemade linguini. My husband ordered the alfredo with chicken, and she informed him that it came with a meal to go. He made his choice on which he wanted to go at that time as well. After we were done and we asked for the check, she took my leftovers and brought us lemon cookies with candles to celebrate our anniversary which was really sweet of her! The cookies were so good we brought 12 to go. \n\nWhen we unpacked our bag after getting home we realized that she didn't put the second meal for my husband in the bag, and he was super disappointed about that so definitely check your bags or remind your waiter\/waitress if you're really looking forward to diving into that extra dish later.","categories":["Restaurants","Nightlife","Italian","Bars"]}

Zuppa de Pesce, another favorite, comes in a tomato red sauce and is loaded with seafood - very rich in flavor as well. The Gnocci is also delicious, however, I thought that this a was little heavy. The spaghetti alla vongole was another great dish, just needed a little bit more seasoning, as it tasted a little bit bland, but nothing that a little salt couldn't do. The grilled octopus is also delicious - both soft and bold in flavors in every bite. Don't forget to get their gelato! My go to is the baccio and the Stracciatella.

It replaced some trapeze lessons (at least I think it did) in a previously vacant lot - so even if it was just a beer\/food cart I would have been happy about it.

We still go frequently, the place has expanded in that time but kept the same great vibe. \n\nI've traveled across Ireland from Dublin to Galway and back, and visited a good number of pubs while there. Dargan's is obviously a somewhat California-ized pub, but it's also got a sincere Irish feeling as soon as you walk in. \n\nLive music a number of nights per week, and the crowd is always a good mix. Friendly for kids (my wife and I have two of those now, and they love visting Dargan's too).  Reliable spot for watching sports as well... watched the 2010 World Cup here and it was a great vibe.\n\nSummary: if you're looking for a friendly pub environment with good food and drink, Dargan's will do you right.","categories":["Restaurants","Bars","Irish","Nightlife","Pubs","Gastropubs"]}

Everything done here is around patient comfort.  Whether you're just getting a cleaning or if you're getting something more serious done, all they want to do is make sure you are comfortable.\n\nOne thing I like is that if you request it they will use nitrous which makes it so much easier to have dental work done if you are apprehensive.  \n\nThe cleaning I've had done here was great with the person doing it being very careful and mindful of my comfort.  I also had a crown put on here which was all done in one day and one single appointment which was nice.\n\nAfter having work done Dr. Struby has called us to make sure the patient is OK which is a nice gesture.

{"stars":5,"text":"Best. Brazilian. Ever.\n\nIf you look through my reviews, you'll find that I had a rather unpleasant experience at another waxing studio. This place, specifically Evelyn, surpassed all of my expectations and I cannot believe I almost swore off Brazilians after my last experience.\n\nFirst off, thank goodness for online booking! It's 2018, no one has time to pick up the phone..just kidding, they do..but I really like the ease of online scheduling. Their website has all the info you need including their super affordable prices. They do have a cancellation policy in place but it's nothing too ridiculous. \n\nNow, on to my experience -- I booked a brazilian and another body part for 3:30pm on a Saturday. I ended up getting there at 3pm (#nervous), and to my surprise, was able to be seen early! This is where I met a waxing angel in the form of a very sweet lady named Evelyn. I quickly realized she was chatting me up to keep my mind off of any potential discomfort. She explained to me the pros to getting brazilians done regularly, and the few hairs she couldn't get, she explained why (no shaving ladies!). Honestly, I think she may have done a max of 10-12 pulls and it was all done! \n\nI admit that I did take some ibuprofen beforehand (and may or may not have had a screwdriver..I wasn't driving though!) and would recommend some combination of this to anyone feeling anxious about the pain. From start to finish, the whole process took no more than 25 minutes. \n\nQuick, professional, and affordable..what else could you ask for from someone taking care of your hoo-ha?!

{"stars":5,"text":"I've had my share of terrible hair experiences.  My hair is full and wavy, and there's a lot of ways that stylists can go wrong with that.  Sometimes they try to razor it into submission.  Sometimes they cut straight-across layers so that I look more like a traffic cone than a human. Sometimes they take out the thinning sheers and start cutting huge chunks out for lack of any better ideas of how to tame it.  Every time I move to a new place and have to find a new hairdresser, I go with some amount of fear and dread that I'm going to walk out worse than I started.\n\nThankfully, Caitlin at Verde Salon also has voluminous, wavy hair, and she knows exactly what to do (and what not to do!) with it.  I left the salon with a haircut that looked great ... and it stayed great the next day, the next week, and for the next few months.  Once my hair was getting a little heavy and long I went back to Caitlin, and again she's given me a great cut.\n\nBesides the usual hairdresser banter about how my day is going, Caitlin talked to me about how to style my hair on a daily basis.  She seemed to completely understand that I'm pretty low maintenance with my hair, so her suggestions were all very easy variants on my morning routine, like changing when I brush my hair so that I can retain more of its natural wave.\n\nOverall, the service at Verde is very nice.  Making an appointment was no problem.  The lady at the front desk is friendly and offers you a drink right away for while you're waiting.  My hair was washed by Caitlin, and the experience felt great and smelled great.\n\nI do get a sense that the staff is encouraged to sell you hair products after your visit, but I think most salons do that.  In fact, I'd been looking for a leave-in conditioner, so I bought one to try, and I've been really happy with it.  Verde has a ton of promotions running, like becoming a \"Verdinista\" (a paid membership with benefits), and a buy-ten-products-get-one-free card.  I would recommend looking up the details of the Verdinista program online before going to the salon because it's a little overwhelming to stand at the desk and figure out if it's something that would be worthwhile to you personally.\n\nI would definitely recommend Verde to a friend!  Since Yelp doesn't have a ton of recent reviews for hair salons in Collingswood, I'm happy to leave a recommendation here as well.","categories":["Nail Salons","Shopping","Cosmetics & Beauty Supply","Beauty & Spas","Hair Extensions","Hair Salons","Hair Stylists"]}

Really?  You're certainly allowed your opinion but this is the most inappropriate atmosphere and time to NOT keep them to yourself.\"  I don't typically even entertain someone like that but given the circumstances with my sweet little I couldn't stand it.

They are delicious!! The server brought us fresh naan every 10 minutes. I started with a samosa, actually a Choley Samosa, filled with potatoes, peas and chickpeas, the best part is that I didn't feel the seeds of cumin, this was a nice surprise. On my second plate I had a little bit of everything else, chicken Tikka Masala, Tandoori chicken, lamb curry, fish amritsari, some basmati rice, etc. Hands down this is my best experience on Indian food so far.\n\nThe service was good, a little slow at the beginning but I guess servers thought we all new what to do so they took their time to come to our table; but when we were back from the buffet table we found water cups for every one, few baskets of naam bread and few plates of dip sauce\/appetizer based on yogurt.\n\nThere is plenty parking lot on this businesses area so parking is not an issue, they also have high chairs for kids.

Granted, I have only been to four other Ethiopian restaurants and they were all on the west coast and three of them were in the San Francisco area, but Meskerem definitely blows them out of the water. In a word, the dishes are saturating. Both in substance and flavor. It is hard for me to choose what to get whenever I have a chance to go, so I typically just order the Meskerem platter because I love everything on it. My favorite is still the tibs wat but the yebeg alecha wat and the doro wat are also amazing meat dishes, and the vegetarian dishes like the lentils or the cabbage are both great. There's something for everyone. Many dishes are quite mild so don't be afraid, just ask which dishes are spicy.

We were shortly seated and serviced quickly. The waiters were very nice, and attended to all our needs.\n\nTheir wine selection was pretty nice. Had plenty of local options, as well as other brands. I should also mention that they have a full bar, so even if it's not on their lists, you can still request it.\n\nWe started off with the calamari as an appetizer. I've had several calamari dishes before, but theirs just took the cake. Their calamari was fluffy and chewy, but not too chewy. The waiter told us that all of their seafood is caught locally and served fresh. You could definitely taste the difference in quality. \n\nFor the main dishes, my girlfriend ordered the gnocchi, and I ordered the rack of lamb. One our food was cooked, it came beautifully arranged. According to my girlfriend, the gnocchi was wonderful. The portion was also rather large too. As for my dish, the lamb was amazing delicious. The meat was caramelized on the outsidr, but tender on the inside. It breaks apart slowly as you chew it, releasing all its flavors.\n\nFor desert, we ordered the phyllo crisp. Simply gorgeous. Their desert menu also comes with a selection of desert drinks and cocktails, if that's your fancy. \n\nOverall, amazing service and quality.

{"stars":4,"text":"Overall this is a really great place to stay!\n\nMy best friend and i decided to take an impromptu getaway. He called me on Wednesday and since I didn't have anything planned for the weekend, I jumped online to find a deal. I booked this hotel through the PriceLine Negotiator! I usually use Hotwire but this was my first time trying something different. I got it for a really good rate compared to everything else I was seeing so I would probably use it again. Since I already know these sites give you rooms the hotel couldn't sell, I immediately called the hotel and requested two double beds like we always do.\n\nWhen I called, the young lady was very friendly and said she would get it taken care of for me. We arrived in Tampa on Friday evening. When we got to the front desk, the gentleman was courteous and went to check us in right away. Unfortunately there was no record of my call and they had us booked in a king suite. Of course, all of the double bed rooms were sold out and there was nothing they could do. \n\nAs a customer service quality analyst, I know that mistakes can happen and I'm big on seeing what you are gonna do to make things right. Don't tell me what you CAN'T do. Lets focus on what you CAN do. Fortunately, I remembered the name of the person I spoke to and she turned out to be the sales director. He tried to call her but was unable to reach her. He then called his manager who let him know there was nothing they could really do about the room.\n\nHe let us know he could trying to call and speak to. Manager in the morning. He offered to buy one of us dinner at the hotel restaurant and so someone else gave us free wifi. We also got a late checkout. Overall, they handled the situation decently but everything we got, we pretty much had to ask for it. I would have liked for them to offer some of these things vs. us having to ask them what they will do to make things right. \n\nEnough about that situation! We got into the room and it was very spacious. The bed is in a separate room by itself with a door. There is a pullout sofa bed in the room that came in handy. The bathroom was clean and roomy. There's nothing worse than a small cramped bathroom and that definitely wasn't a problem here. There is a small fridge and a microwave. They also have a tv in the bedroom and one I the suite with the couch. For the price we paid, it was a great deal. \nThey also offer complimentary breakfast! I'm not talking just cereal and muffins... I'm talking an omelette station, waffles, eggs, bacon, sausage, breads, muffins and all types of deliciousness! I definitely enjoyed that. \n\nThey have a pool but its really small. If you're looking to do some laps, this is not the pool for you. It looks like the type of outdoor pool you just add to be able to add it to your amenities list. The room service choices are great but we didn't get anything. The location is cool. It's kinda tucked away down a street with a dead end. \n\nI would definitely come back and stay here again. Hope you enjoy your stay!","categories":["Hotels & Travel","Hotels","Venues & Event Spaces","Event Planning & Services"]}

As you arrive, you are welcomed with a delightful tasting of champagne to begin a spectacular dining experience. Of course I reviewed the menu extensively before arriving, my only question was a wine pairing. Our server was thoughtful about choosing a wine that would pair well with mine and my friends entrees. They kept the wine chilled and never let our glasses go empty. For my main course I chose shrimp and grits. The best chefs season every item individually, and at Tinker Street the flavor sensation is phenomenal.  Tinkers special touch on shrimp and grits was the perfect amount of spice that has you craving the next bite. The thick cut ham adds to this rich comfort foods savory flavor. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!\n\nAlso Consumed: \nMushroom Bruschetta - Truffle Golden Syrup- Nuff said \nRuby Grapefruit Salad- Perfectly tossed, with a gentle dressing that allows the fresh ingredients to shine \nApple Dutch Baby - I had a lot of wine by this point..

{"stars":4,"text":"My husband and I dined here for our \"Pre-Valentine's\" dinner on the recommendation of our wedding caterer. This guy told us it was in his top 5 favorite restaurants of all time, and would not stop badgering us about going every time we saw him, so we finally bit the bullet and made our reservations.\n\n*On a somewhat related note, I had bought my parents a gift certificate to Melange for Christmas because of my caterer's recommendation, despite having not eaten there yet, and got a free dessert coupon when I did. So that was a plus!\n\nAnyway, it was the Saturday before Valentine's Day so we knew it would be packed and even though the place isn't that big, we did not feel squished at all. In fact we had a nice little two-top by the window. And then the feeding frenzy began. They instantly brought out bread and butter for us. Then came roasted red peppers and some kind of firm cheese in balsamic vinegar (complimentary). Then we had our soup (mine) and salad (his). The soup bowl was so large and the soup itself so filling, that I had to stop half way through for fear of being too full to eat anything else. Creamy Roasted tomato and crab soup, with big chunks of real crab was delish! I even got my husband to try a lump of crab and he hates soup. That's how good it was. Then for appetizer we had barbecued shrimp with mini biscuits in some kind of Cajun cream sauce. Another home run and then on to the meals. He had bacon wrapped duck breast over dirty rice I think, and I had the buttermilk fried chicken with bourbon mashed sweet potatoes. The portions were ridiculous so I had to take the other 2 out of 3 chicken breasts I got home. (I ate it for lunch the next day. Still yummy.) Of course since we \"live large\" when we eat out so to speak, we had to order dessert. But by this time we were stuffed, so we got them to go. We must have looked like the biggest pigs ever to set foot in that restaurant but I didn't care. It was Valentine's Day after all. So we finished up and paid and went on our merry way to eat our pecan pie and bourbon bread pudding in the luxury of our home. And sweatpants.\n\nMy only qualm with the whole experience is that the service was a little slow. I know good food takes time, especially when the house is packed, but when you are sitting there for several minutes waiting just to be greeted by your server who is right next to you talking to the other table and not even acknowledging your presence, it's kinda not cool. But maybe she was new so I'll give her a pass. It definitely  won't keep me from going to Melange again for a special occasion.","categories":["Restaurants","Cajun\/Creole"]}

{"stars":5,"text":"Bottomline: Definitely a destination worth visiting multiple times!\n\nHISTORY: The Franklin Mortgage & Investment Company brought the Craft Cocktail Revolution into full swing for the City of Philadelphia. Originally setup as an offshoot of Death + Co. (NYC), The Franklin took on its own identity after a band of devoted bartenders served with long tenures, securing Franklin's place at the top.\n\nIDENTITY CRISIS: As The Industry is always in flux, so too are most craft cocktail bars. Bartenders have come and gone; visions of bar programming have changed over; the upstairs hair salon was annexed to provide a more casual vibe; the name was briefly simplified to \"The Franklin.\" But then it went back to its roots and took back its first name and reinvented the upstairs as a proper tiki bar.\n\nDRINKS: The downstairs remains an intimate drinking den worthy of a visit from anywhere...and then a revisit to sample from the seasonally-updated array of masterfully crafted cocktails! N.B. Like Death + Co., the bar's menu features cocktails crafted from intricate infusions, uncommon bottles, and paragraph-length lists of ingredients - in other words, you can't easily do this at home!","categories":["Cocktail Bars","Nightlife","Lounges","Bars"]}

Probably the best burger I've had in Boise, but I don't think its 5-star quality. I just had the regular cheese burger with fries and a shake. The burger was tasty, but not overly fantastic as I was lead to believe. The fries were thick, but I like that so it was good for me. The shake was also good, but I preferred the shake over at Bad Boys Burgers.\n\nOverall, I gave it 4 stars. I also bought a t-shirt there.

It also has Korean BBQ, which is not as authentic as their hot pot and I would not recommend.\n\nThey have a few hot pot base to choose from. I always choose the spicy base as I'm from Chengdu. I personally think the base is okay (it's at an acceptable level offered outside Sichuan\/Chongqing areas) but not authentic enough. I tried my dining companions' other bases, which are lighter and less spicy. However, there's only one type of of hot pot base from the eyes of Sichuanese -- Spicy hot pot base. The food for hot pot\/BBQ are fresh in general and comes with a nice selection, and you can build your own sauce using the sauce bar.\n\nMake a reservation if you can, because eating hot pot takes a lot of time and the waiting time can be very long.","categories":["Korean","Restaurants","Chinese","Barbeque","Hot Pot"]}
{"stars":4,"text":"I went to this store to experience the famous Blue Bell ice cream. My Southern and Texas friends swear it is the best ice cream on the earth. When someone says, \"Best on the earth,\" that is like throwing down the ice scoop to a challenge. \n\nThe Blue Bell is located in the front of the store. It's on the backside of the huge glass display case for the truffles, caramel apples and specialty chocolates. When I went, I was expecting maybe six or so flavors being offered on a rotating schedule. To my surprise, there were over two dozen flavors to choose from. For a brief moment I felt like a kid in a candy shop. Oh wait, I was in a candy shop, that had an ice cream parlor too. \n\nThe young lady working the counter was very patient with me, as I was having a hard time selecting my first Blue Bell flavor. I finally went with, Birthday Cake. It was a rich creamy vanilla with pieces of chocolate cake and swirls of chocolate icing and bright colored sprinkles. I'm sure you have heard, sprinkles are for winners. After enjoying my Blue Bell, I now understand not only the love the South has for this ice cream, but why the South has an obesity problem. This ice cream is too good to resist. \n\nNow, I'll talk about the RSC. This store was amazing, I had no idea they had so much to offer. They had pre-boxed, by the piece, Jelly Belly jelly beans, Weight Watchers candy and some the most decadent caramel apples. This is a great place for picking up a gift for that special Aunt, Grandma or person that stumps you every time on what to get them. \n\nPersonally I prefer local chocolates, Kakao and Bissinger's, but for gifts and Blue Bell, I will keep this candy store on my shopping list.","categories":["Candy Stores","Chocolatiers & Shops","Desserts","Specialty Food","Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt","Bakeries","Food"]}

{"stars":4,"text":"We managed to get reservations here on a Friday night. It was definitely busy and lively when we arrived at 6:30. We were a little disappointed that a few of the things that we had heard were really good we're not on the menu. While I do appreciate a revolving and changing menu it is nice to have expectations of certain meals and I would prefer a restaurant have some classics that stay the same that you can count on being available. \nSo we started with some cocktails, which we heard were a must have. I did really enjoy the unique selection that they had and the interesting ingredients that I definitely could not make myself at home. Beware the price of the cocktails are expensive. You will pay $13 a glass. When did getting a drink in an Edmonton restaurant become so expensive? Not only are all cocktails $13 or more, a glass of wine will run you from $12-$15. This is a trend that is starting to drive me crazy. But back to the meal.\nI got the 'Sour' cocktail while my wife got the 'Old fashion'. Both were very well done, just not sure if worth $13\nWe decided to share a plate from all 4 courses. Out appetizer was the Charcuterie. There were some fantastic meats on this dish. The cheese was disappointing simply because there was so little of it. Just 2 little  slivers. The Italian Center gives you more when you ask for a taste of cheese in there deli. The bread however was delicious and the aioli dip was also very tasty. The waitress made a rather annoying mistake at this point. She brought out our second dish while we still had half of our charcuterie plate uneaten. The charcuterie plate is a rather large cutting board so adding an additional plate when we were obviously not ready for it, made for a cramped small table. Thankfully we had ordered the smoked salmon which was a cold plate, so at least the food didn't sit there getting cold.\nThe smoked salmon was very good, with nice big chunks of salmon with crispy capers and a cucumber salad with dill and red onion..\nOur main plate was the brisket. It came with grits and crispy broccoli covered in a cheese style sauce. The brisket itself was very tender and excellent tasting.\nWe finished with the rice pudding. None of the desserts really wowed us from the description but the waitress recommended the pudding. It was good as far as rice pudding goes. We were really hoping that the crepe 'galette' would be on the menu but it was not. We would have liked to have seen some more creativity when it came to the desserts.\nWe finished with a glass of Ros\u00e9 which was excellent (although it did cost $10 a glass - still too pricey)\nWe will come back to Woodwork but would think twice about ordering both cocktails and wine. One more thing to note is that it is loud in the restaurant. To have a conversation with the person sitting across from you, you almost have to shout. While it is nice to be somewhere where people are having fun and full of life but some type of sound dampening would be nice.","categories":["Cafes","Canadian (New)","Restaurants","Cocktail Bars","Bars","Nightlife"]}

It doesn't matter what type of meat product you love - beef, pork, chicken, seafood - Mixto will serve it most deliciously.  My favorite dish so far has to be the Bandeja Tipica, which is a beef dish that is served with Mixto's wonderful selection of side dishes that I girl like me can ask for - maduros, plantains, beans, chorizo, egg...ok, actually, what gets me sold each time I come here are the side dishes.  They define the completeness of the dishes.  If there is anything else, there is the feeling of a well-rounded meal that you get at Mixto.

The consistency of the salsa was also superb. \n\nI went with the tacos de carne asada (dinner portion) which is $12. It's a little bit more than say Vallarta's, but the quality was superior and honestly one of the best tacos de carne asada that I have enjoyed in Tampa Bay. Not one piece of meat or topping was left uneaten. I use carne asada to gauge a quality Mexican restaurant and if I like it - I become more adventurous during future visits with their menu. \n\nLa Fuente also carries Mexican Jarrito's sodas, which was a plus. I enjoyed my favorite pineapple flavor. I love it when restaurants carry authentic sodas or juices from their homeland. There was no horchata though, hopefully they will add it someday in the future to the menu. \n\nThe waitress told us in a few hours they were preparing for live-music with a Mexican mariachi band which was certainly interesting and I know I will definitely be having Mexican food in the future at La Fuente in New Tampa.","categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"]}

{"stars":4,"text":"After dodging oncoming vehicles near the construction outside and swimming through the fabric hanging near the entrance, I made my way into H&C. \n\nThe decor and ambiance of this place is really special. It's dimly lit (like a lot of other places). The bar is wrap around with interesting light fixtures and cozy couches and arm chairs are present near the entrance. \n\nWe dug ourselves into one of the couches. My main goal of going to this place at 6pm was for happy hour but we did not receive any happy hour menu or mention of happy hour so I wasn't sure it existed here. I've heard from friends that the happy hour here is great so I'm not sure what happened, but if there was happy hour and we weren't notified, that's kinda messed up actually. \n\nAnyways, 2 of the drinks particularly appealed to me. One of them was vodka with elderflower liqueur, strawberries, and sparkling wine or champagne. I did see tequila with chilies and blood orange soda which I could not pass up. It came in a tall glass, enticing color, and contained a tree branch. It tasted absolutely spectacular, the chilies added a nice zing. It took every drop of self control for me to not finish the damn thing in 2 swigs but I somehow managed to stretch it out to a good 5-10 minutes. \n\nThe appetizer options were limited, imo. There are the classic charcuterie and cheese plates. There's like also some dinner options like pizzas and pastas and shit. I'm down to try the dinner here and\/or brunch.\n\nUPDATE: tried dinner here last evening. \nCheese plate: underwhelming, only 3 kinds of cheeses and 2\/3 of them were hardish with some variety lacking. The rustic bread slices given were delicious, as was the granola type side and some pickled green beans. Cheese plate here is pass-able.\n\nBrussels sprouts: fucking amazing. The sprouts are in what I would describe as a balsamic vinegaresque sauce and seasoned with herbs and these amazing chili slices with almond slivers on top. Absolutely delicious. Must get this shit.\n\nChestnut gnocchi: the kale pesto isn't so much a pesto as some kale leaves and oil but holy shit this was amazing as well. The gnocchi were chunky little potato-dough balls wrapped with kale and ricotta (we asked for ours without mushrooms I'm pretty sure but for all I know I could've sucked down a couple mushrooms with it and not have noticed after a few drinks). This is a must.\n\nLast but not least, we also went with the spinach pizza. That crust was AMAZING. Like perfectly soft and crispy on the edges. Spinach was of the perfect consistency after being in the oven. The garlic, as always, added a wonderful flavor along with the ricotta. Absolutely spec-fucking-tacular. Sometimes spinach pizza repulses me but this was divine.","categories":["Active Life","Nightlife","Bars","American (Traditional)","Bowling","Restaurants","American (New)","Gastropubs"]}

I've come here on multiple occasions. If you're watching your waist, a petite burrito will definitely do the trick. My personal favorite is the Kale and Quiona, but please be aware this is coming from a Kale Enthusiast. \n\nOn a different occupation I ordered the greenscile smoothie, which was also delicious but did not completely knock my socks off, the next time I will probably add chia or something a little extra to give it more substance. \n\nI'm not giving thie 5 stars because of 2 reasons.There are slight miscommunication errors between the register and the cooking staff. Each time I've went to Animo, there is 1 person on the register and a line out the door. Most recently I ordered a Banana Whip, paid for it then found out 10 minutes after the fact that they were out of product. Rather than provide a discount, a coupon or anything for the inconvenience I was asked to switch out for something else. I'm not one to expect anything from everyone, but when you're running a competitive business in Center City, your game should be top notch.

The char-grilled oysters are beautiful.  In a town filled with oysters of all types, these stand out and Felix's in particular. The char and heat of the shell housing these seafood morsels drowning in butter and breadcrumbs is enough for a meal in itself, but I suggest sticking with 6-12 of these and combining it with their crawfish po'boy or their etouffee.  Both are worth the price of admission (which is quite affordable).  Ambiance is cold but fun.  Think classic no-frills short order eatery for how it is (or isnt) decorated.  Ignore it.

{"stars":5,"text":"Forest & Main is great.  They have delicious, creative beers (which is why you go) and a wide enough variety of them at any given time that pretty much all beer drinkers can be accommodated, and the food measures up to the high bar that the beers set.  The food is mostly basic \"American\" (i.e. burgers and such, maybe on the classier end of that category), but the dishes often have just enough of a twist to be interesting without getting weird, and the kitchen staff know how to prepare things right.\n\nThe best thing about Forest & Main besides the beer is the friendly ambiance that works its way through everything.  It's an old house in which beer lovers started brewing beer.  The interior seems to have undergone minimal changes from when it was someone's residence.  The servers and bartenders seem to like being there and they operate competently without needing a script.  The vibe is unusually natural, like some guy down the block invited the neighborhood to stop in for a good dinner and good drinks.\n\nForest & Main is definitely worth checking out.","categories":["Gastropubs","Restaurants","Breweries","Food"]}

{"stars":5,"text":"Pinnacle Wellness is a hidden gem in Reno! Kerri is so welcoming and extremely knowledgeable about natural healing and wellness. My boyfriend and I originally started going just for the foot\/hand detox, but have now been going nearly every week for several months and have tried just about all of their modalities! We live in South Lake Tahoe and will sometimes drive to Reno just for a some relaxing time at Pinnacle.\n\nYou will be amazed at what comes out of your body with the detox! Especially if you have a good workout or use the chi machine beforehand. Once you see (and smell, ewww) what it pulls out, you will be hooked! We almost always do a detox when we're there, but love so many of the modalities! The salt room is amaaaaazing! So peaceful and great for respiratory problems, skin problems and many other things. The chi machine with the jade mat is another favorite! Really helps with my lower back pain and the mat is nice and toasty-warm so I usually doze off. I also love the Feng Shui pod, which uses steam and aroma\/sound therapy for a variety of programs, like \"stress-relief\", \"rejuvenate\", etc. The Vitamin D bed is great for gloomy winters. There's an oxygen bar with colloidal silver, great for overall immune support! There's even a sauna! There are so many different things to try, you could probably spend an entire day here, which is why we really love the punch-cards because it makes it all very easy and affordable and you can just pop in and use whatever is open. You can even book parties there, which I think would be so fun!\n\nAnother benefit is she serves Blue Dot water, which is so yummy and refreshing, and you're in for a treat if you come on a day with the \"Kerri Cocktail\"! So good!!\n\nWe are so thankful to have found this spot and to have discovered it while it's still a hidden gem.

{"stars":5,"text":"So Ive been back a handful of times since my last review and thought it was time to update. We've pretty much tried everything on the menu and nothing ever disappoints. Whats funny about most of the food is the first bite is usually underwhelming and youre worried you made a bad choice. Then something happens to your brain and you discover you love it and end up craving it. Ive brought friends who said the same thing. \nWhats also cool is their awesome ever changing drink menu. Its very rare that I see more than a couple drinks on a cocktail list that look appealing to me. Their mixologist, Hannah, is a genius. Plus the fact they make their own marachino cherries, bitters, purees, etc doesnt hurt either. The wait is usually long ( around an hour) so we ens up finding a seat at the bar hence the reason I know the bartenders name by heart;)  It is pricey but it is quality and also a cuisine you can find anywhere else in the city. Like my first review, its sophisticated comfort food.","categories":["Cajun\/Creole","Seafood","Restaurants"]}
{"stars":4,"text":"I have been coming to The Wal since the mid 80s, when I was a student at UNR. It is a college hangout, probably the most famous in Reno. The drink deals are really good - for example, you can make a cocktail a double for only $2. LOTS of cold beers on tap! \n\nSometimes it gets a but loud and rowdy for my taste, but again, it's a college bar. I do avoid the trike races and the like. But it's a cool, casual place to hang out, with Wolf Pack memorabilia (though not as much as the old days). I like the place and even belong to its \"Mug Club\" - for $30\/year, you get a custom-made ceramic beer mug with original designs based on YOUR chosen nickname, then you get good discounts when you order a beer in it (they'll keep it there for you, just ask for your number).  The food is just okay in general, though the burgers are decent. I'd give it 5 stars if the food was better.\n\nAs someone mentioned, The Wal is a part of Reno's history, been there since 1922. I recommend it as a casual, drop-in for a cold one kind of place.","categories":["Sports Bars","Nightlife","Restaurants","Pizza","Burgers","Beer Gardens","Bars","Barbeque"]}

(He also owns Butcher & Singer and Morimoto).\n\nYou could either sit inside or outside, and both choices are good. Even thought they have fire torches outside, I would love to come back and sit outside in the summer. Inside decorations are nature-friendly..lots of wood-based chairs and tables. You can think this place is well designed because all the furniture are the forest style but slightly different. \"Life\" and \"Beauty\" are painted on the wall. \n\nAll the dishes are fresh and delicious. They described every dish in details in the menu, which help me a lot to make a choice.\n\nCheese Plate: World Travel\nEven though I didnt remember any name of the eight cheeses, I love each and every of them. The eight cheese choices are very eight different country, from Latin America to Europe. Some of them are very unique. I recall one cheese was made with potato, it looks like cream cheese, but the flavor is very rich and creamy. \nThe restaurant severed bread and cracker with the cheese plate.\n\nEntree: Seared Day Boat Scallops\nFresh and flavored! I am not a big fun of carrot, but I did love carrots in this dish. It was soft, and the vegetable taste of carrot was not strong. \n\nP.S: Def pick a cheese plate!! I think they are famous of their cheese collections. I personally think their cheese is the best in Philly, even over all other Italian restaurants I v ever been,","categories":["American (New)","Restaurants"]}

As a matter of fact, the attachment to the grocery store may actually be a benefit. I mean they have any ingredients they want right on hand anytime... \nThe interior is nicely done, upscale, classy, interesting.\nThe staff is friendly and very professional.\nI ventured in here with my little foodie group for Devour Indy. You can't beat 3 courses for $20. And here is what we thought of the dishes we tried:\n\nBACON WRAPPED SHRIMP\njasmine rice salad, lemongrass vinaigrette, papaya salsa * absolutely delicious, different that one would expect, the 3 large savory grilled shrimp over the cold tropical rice with a hint of sweetness... a beautiful pairing. \n\nPORK & PORK\ngrilled tenderloin, crispy belly, curried carrot puree, lemongrass, faro, corn, cognac reduction * visually not that pleasing, but taste wise quite delightful and engaging, a nice pairing of various flavors that engage your entire palette.\n\nUMAMI BURGER 2.0\nporcini Mayo, Truffle Parmesan Fondue, Balsamic Onion, Tomato Jam * delicious beef patty mingling with the flavor of all the 'sauces' it is topped with. The accompanying fries so good, we couldn't stop  until they were all gone. Crisp on the outside and tender on the inside and beautifully seasoned.\n\nFARO ISLAND SALMON\navocado hummus, quinoa salad, Korean BBq * OMG, you must try this. The hummus nice and creamy, the Quinoa salad interesting with a little lemony flavor to it, the salmon glazed to perfection with that Korean flavor of BBQ, flaky deliciousness.\n\nFETTUCCINI\nbasil pesto, peas, asparagus, lemon ricotta * what a good smelling bowl of pasta. While I did not personally taste it, the smell coming from it made me want to dive in there head first, yeah that good. \n\nMISO CHOCOLATE POT DE CREME\nespresso whipped cream, peanut brittle, smoked salt * a tiny bit of creamy heaven, the folks who ordered this seemed to be in heaven with every bite\n\nBURNT ALMOND CAKE\nberries * the description doesn't do this cake justice... let me see if I can do better. A triangle of a two-layer yellow cake with a distinct almond flavor, it has a creamy filling in the middle with a slight lemony taste, topped with icing that seems to be a mix of fondant and marzipan, very sweet and almondy and it is covered in candied slivered almonds... in dother words a triangle of deliciousness... and the best  part, it is sold in the store... so I guess it can be an advantage to dine in a grocery store... half my group went to purchase more of that  cake on their way out. \n\nThe portions for the Devour Indy event were really generous.

I think my pina colada was $7 or $8, and I downed it in approximately five minutes (see above: hot, sticky afternoon). So cold. So refreshing. So rum-tastic.\n\nThe next time I am lucky enough to find myself in the sweltering summer heat of New Orleans, I'm making a beeline to the Organic Banana.","categories":["Restaurants","Food","Juice Bars & Smoothies","Nightlife","Cocktail Bars","Bars","American (Traditional)","Local Flavor","Drive-Thru Bars"]}

Out of all the dish there \"Potatoes Crunch Wrap\" is the best!!! Highly recommend dish or appetizer. It is a crispy oven baked bread with stuffing inside.

Opted for chicken salad sandwich and the strawberry and gorgonzola salad with field greens, candied pecans and balsamic vinaigrette dressing.  The mix of flavors in the salad was quite good.  The chicken salad sandwich was also quite good.

But it's so much more than that.  \nLet me explain, you are greeted by some really friendly adults who want nothing more than to serve and make sure you know the ropes. \nSigning in is a breeze, just download their app but if you don't have that yet, they'll sign you in and you enter the doors into the most sanitary, bright and airy let's get down to business ambiance ever. The colors are red and black. Brand new mats under your feet and a mirror as long as the room, the lighting is just right and there is a timer clock on the wall which they use to countdown exercises. Off in the distance you see some bags of red which you know are intended for you to kick and punch but when you get down to it, the training is far more than throwing some blows. You thought you could go toe to toe in the ring until you realize you need to work on that endurance. More on that later. At the opposite end you find a just as clean and esthetically pleasing locker room. I mosey on over to the right as that's the ladies locker room equipped with the lockers that need no key, mouthwash which I have mistaken for hand soap (really how thoughtful can these people be), hair dryer, and showers to name a few things that make me happy. A few pumps of mouthwash later (I no longer practice this method for hand washing) and it's time to get into Krav Maga mode. But there are more than self defensive classes available, these friendly people have a staff of yoga instructors, monkey bar gym trainers for building strength and conditioning (if you want to dominate that next obstacle course, well you Want this class!), boot camp groups, youth self defense classes, kettle bell training, and ROCK STEADY BOXING for those with Parkinson's Disease (my dad needs this class, talk to Mr. Tom) and even a class for those with Autism. Anti-Bullying class on how to identify bullying, etc. Krav Maga at Triumph of Metairie is a family of trained professionals who pour their wisdom and knowledge into you. They truly make you feel comfortable at any level of your physical fitness. And no one judges. If you have goals they want to hear about them because each of them want to help and see you succeed. \"Krav Maga was developed in the 1950s; originally taught to the Israeli Army; instruction for civilians began in late 70s.\", as per the Krav Maga Institute website. Also, \"Krav Maga is a pure self defense and striking system.\" \"Train to save our own lives and the lives of our loved ones.\" \"So that one may walk in peace.\"-Imi Lichenfeld, the founder. I recommend this not for just your fitness level goals as there are so many benefits but for the camaraderie and the level of awareness and wisdom you develop as you progress. There is something to be said about such a feeling of confidence from just a few classes. I don't see myself going anywhere else to train, ever.

Though, I recommend giving the office a call and ask for the wait time before venturing out here.  I was also advise, Monday and Fridays are the worst days to come here.  Seems everyone either comes at the beginning or end of the week.\n\nWalking in on a Wednesday, along with calling ahead of time to check the wait, kept my trip short.  While renewing my license, all the staff were helpful and friendly.  Any questions I had, they answered without issue.\n\nCome here if you every need to do anything associated with the DMV.","categories":["Departments of Motor Vehicles","Education","Specialty Schools","Public Services & Government"]}

I had a heck of a them booking it otherwise I would have given five stars I called to book and when I called back two times I got a tape and left a message. When Lindsay at the front desk called me back the time I wanted was booked by someone on line already. I was disappointed especially snide when they are busy it doesn't let you hold it forces you to leave a message. Let's talk about the service and hair results.\n     Hannah greeted me with a hand shake and a smile. We consulted at her staton. She offered a quick head and shoulder massage. Yes please. I was then taken for shampoo and offers a hot towel and hand massage. Yes please. I was then taken back to her station for my mini keratin. She did a wonderful job with my hair and made sure to explain after care, information $75 it was a great deal. I tipped her $20 since she did the double washes and mini massages. She certainly earned it. The front desk when I arrived was nice and offered me a drink. They also were delightful when I left. Only other minus was no internet In a salon that loves to have you book online. Nice place and wonderful service. I'm not local but If here again I would make the drive here again. I'm in tone at the Conrad and this was the only salon that offered mini keratin that usually lasts four weeks. Lindsay at desk just a sweetheart. Hannah wonderful stylist. Go and get this service.

If you are ever in the market for a new firearm, CHECK HERE FIRST!!!\n\nAbout a week ago I sent Cracker Boys a Facebook message asking if they were able to find a specific pistol that had been discontinued. They responded very quickly that unfortunately they were no longer able to order the gun I was looking for from any of their distributors. Ok, I can understand that...I appreciated their prompt and honest response. But the excellent customer service didn't stop there...they responded that they will do their best to find something I liked, they they \"were on a mission.\" \n\nFor the first time, after contacting at least 3 other places, I got more than just a \"nope\" but rather someone willing to go above and beyond. The next day I hadn't heard back so I figured they got busy and forgot about me. I was wrong! They had been searching for the perfect firearm that was close to what I originally requested, and sent me a message midday with something that I liked even better!\n\nI went in on a Friday to place the order & by the following Tuesday I had my new gun in hand. I really couldn't be more pleased!!!!\n\nSupport your local small businesses. Cracker Boys has a large selection on hand or can special order for other picky shoppers like myself.

I ordered three- one fried shrimp, one fried mahi mahi, and one grilled mahi mahi.  \n\nThese tacos are freaking amazing.\n\nSure, the price is a TAD high at $3.50 per taco, but for the quality you get, as well as the fun atmosphere, it's worth the price.

The meat and wings do not come out with sauce you choose that at the sauce bar (eat in or togo cups available) so if you want to use a dressing or no sauce, no problem!  \n\nThe have lots of sides but ask about the side of the day, it is usually something interesting.   \n\nFamily meals are available and you get a bottle of sauce with them included!\n\nYou can order brisket cut how you like (some like the crusty section, some like the fatty part) let them know, they will try to get it to order.\n\nFinally, I usually go for the typical brisket or pulled pork (or ribs) as default at a BBQ but be sure to try the turkey.

On one of the preview nights, I had a lovely glass of bubbles and sampled a Boulevardier. The other night with the fabulous Shercole, I tried a Rosy Disposition, at first I though the Pernod might be too much for me, but that was just the first sip. Refreshing and delicious. Second I had the Wrong Way Home, so tasty and citrusy. \n\nI also tried the pimento cheese on a saltine which is stupidly delicious and the carrot puree which pops with ginger.\n\nService was great.

Surprisingly, for as many times as I've enjoyed their fried goodness, this was my first time stepping food inside the restaurant myself.  I was most impressed by the lack of a fried food, or \"fishy\" smell. Many seafood restaurants smell of old grease and fried chicken, and I personally find that very off-putting. Jordan's smelled fresh, and clean. The faint food smell was appealing, instead of distracting.\n\nJordan's has the standard fried seafood restaurant fare, ranging from perch and whiting to catfish and shrimp. Their signature wings are a must try, and never disappoint. If you love bursts of flavor, ask for extra lemon pepper seasoning on your order. Trust me, the extra sodium is worth it!\n\nIf you're near a Jordan's, and have a craving for wings, fish, and fries, this is your spot.

{"stars":5,"text":"The Diamond Centre is just a short drive South from Tucson, Arizona, down I-19, that strange interstate marked in kilometers and not miles like every other American highway.  Take Exit 80: West Pima Mine Road.  The Diamond Centre is separated from the Desert Diamond Casino by a small plaza.  If you have \"Will Call,\" go into the casino itself for that is where \"Will Call\" for tickets that are being held is located.  Desert Diamond Casino does not miss a trick, and it wants you to take a look at its casino when you get your tickets in hope that you will return there to eat, drink or gamble after the show.\n\nI saw Rob Thomas here on Saturday, 12 April 2014, and this was the perfect venue for his acoustic performance: small and intimate.  Like several of Tucson's venues, there is not a bad seat in the house.  By its being a modestly-sized auditorium, everyone in the room can both see and hear the artists perfectly.  'Tis a wonderful hall in which to view a musical production.  The seats are comfortable, and there are cash bars located just out of the room in the lobby.  Thomas' show was fantastic.  He told wonderful stories of his life and of other musicians he knew, and he came across as just a great guy.  Amongst other solo and Matchbox 20 numbers he did were terrific versions of \"Disease,\" \"3 AM,\" \"Unwell,\" \"Mockingbird\" and, of course, \"Smooth.\"  Thomas, also, previewed a new song, \"I Think That We Would Feel Good Together,\" that definitely should be a hit.\n\nMy only complaint--and I certainly am not subtracting a star for this as it's not the fault of the Desert Diamond if it's not aware of the problem--would be about some of the concert viewers.  At this concert, this would apply to the claques of young women who felt that the other concert patrons wanted to hear all their personal business loudly discussed during many of Thomas' songs instead of listening to the music that the patrons had paid to hear.  These young women were sorely mistaken.  Nobody wanted to hear the tedious details of their boring personal lives.  (This would, also, apply to the two elderly gents in the balcony who yakked all the way through The Gypsy Kings, concert at the Fox Theatre in May, as well.)  It would well behoove the management of the Desert Diamond to make some sort of announcement as far as showing courtesy to other concert goers as movie theatres do and to have their ushers be prepared to tell these people to hush.  At one point, I wanted to stand up and scream at one of these groups of nattering banshees, \"Could you just shut the f**k up!\"\n\nAfter the show, I did just what Desert Diamond intended for me to do all along: I walked across the plaza and back into the casino.  Most of the slot machines were occupied by preoccupied gamblers who seemed to be quite happy to be spending their Saturday night at the slots.  I myself went over to the Sports Bar, where a goodly crowd--every table was filled--was enjoying the retro-music of the band 80's And Gentlemen.  The musicians were very good and quite energetic, as well as enthusiastic.  When they performed an excellent cover of Madonna's \"Get Into The Groove,\" they had a fair portion of the bar up on its feet and dancing.\n\nThe Diamond Centre is definitely a place to see a concert!","categories":["Casinos","Arts & Entertainment","Hotels & Travel","Hotels","Event Planning & Services"]}

No questions asked.\n\nThings I didn't love so much: \n- Longish line (moderately fast pace, we waited around 15 minutes on a Saturday night at 10:30 pm) - this was on a super cold windy night...not sure how crazy the wait must be in the summer \/ day times\n- Only one flavor in a small (weird considering how large a small is)\n- Limited seating (plan for this when it's cold out, or enjoy your ice cream in an uber as we did) \n\nTips:\n* Cash only \n* They serve ice cream, sundaes, flavored sodas \/ drinks, and brownies \/ cookiestoo \n\nVerdict - will be back when I get those ice cream cravings and Ben and Jerry's just won't cut it.","categories":["Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt","Coffee & Tea","Food","Desserts"]}

{"stars":5,"text":"AviAnna  came recommended by a fellow YE  who thankfully turned me onto a place which I will be frequenting to satisfy cravings for  one of my favorite cuisines- Asian Fusion. I can't wait to bring a few friends here.  It's close to the neighborhood where I grew up in an area that is now bouncing back from the bad economy.\n***  Note: BYOB ( big smiles here).\nThere is parking across Baltimore Pike in a lot for use of Arianna Patrons or you can use cheap metered on-street parking on the same side. It's close to the police station so if you don't use the lot, bring a couple of quarters. 25 cents\/hr.  Try that in Philly! \n\nArriving as they were opening and dining solo, I was happy to be welcomed as if I was bringing in a $200 check. The wait staff were warm, welcoming and helpful. I started with a traditional Thai Iced Tea which was delightful. Before ordering I took a walk around this beautifully decorated space that when I was a kid occupied a doughnut factory- Virginia Donuts. Try as I might I could find no evidence of its blue collar past. Tasteful in its Asian decor, it is pleasant and pretty. There are two jade Buddhas here which are absolutely enchanting. \n\nMenu: - Thai Iced Tea-- The best I've ever had.\n- Duck roll- Duck deep fried in rice paper with scallions and hoison sauce-- Perfection\n- Seafood Hotpot which was Hot and sour soup with lemongrass, exotic spices, mussels,  calamari, scallops, shrimp, salmon, and  vegetables.  A 5 star meal with 5 star service in 5 star surroundings!\n\nI met Joy the owner and mentioned to her about the neighborhood revitalization and how restaurants have been a big part of it. Just then I noticed the banquet facilities in back which were very nice.  The previous night they had served 70 people. The great food will bring in both diners and banquet patrons. Trust me when I say AviAnna is a nice part of Lansdowne's future and will be here for years to come.","categories":["Thai","Restaurants","Vietnamese","Caterers","Event Planning & Services","Laotian","Venues & Event Spaces","Asian Fusion"]}

{"stars":5,"text":"What a fun place!  We went at 3pm on a Sunday.  I presume they are super busy for Brunch earlier on but at this point it was just rather steady.  \nThe atmosphere is bright and airy.  Think a cousin to Hamburger Marys.  Hamburger Marys minus the drag queens.  \nLots of pink.  Lots of kitsch.\nWe had Chasity as a server and she was awesome.  Cute, funny and a good representative for the restaurant.  Everyone we came in contact with was fun, relaxed and funny.  This is always a good sign. It shows they're having fun at work.  The one thing I HATE is when servers are made to greet people in a certain way. In this case it's \"friends.\"  Let the servers own personality shine.  When they're forced to say something it seems, well, forced.  Not relaxed.  Fake.  \nNow on to the food.  Their specialty is clearly hamburgers.  They also have chicken.  We all got double burgers and they were delicious.  Great flavor.  Not too messy or big just to be big.  Just perfect.  I got the fries with all the fixings.  Good but a lot.  I knew that going in though.   \nFor someone wanting more healthy or dietary restrictions they got you covered.  Veggie burgers, shakes with coconut milk as an alternative, burger bowls for those watching their carbs.  Nice that they keep that in mind.  \nI went in here expecting it just to be a theme.  Not much more than that. I was wrong.  This is good even without the theme.","categories":["American (Traditional)","Nightlife","Bars","Restaurants","Burgers"]}

{"stars":4,"text":"Pizzology was my first post-COVID takeout meal after returning  to the US. A bunch of friends had raved about it over the years to me, but living in East Carmel, I'd never tried it. When a friend said she was willing to eat ANYthing, I felt like this was the right time.\n\nUnfortunately, a lot of my food was compromised by the fact that I picked it up before running errands, so by the time we sat down to eat, it had been an hour since I'd gotten the food (one of the many reasons why I plan to go back for a dining experience, along with the fact that I still haven't had their tiramisu yet and haven't experienced the 'watch the chef' opportunity they have).\n\nThat being said, our food - for the way I handled it - was good, adequate, filling, and pleasant. The highlight was definitely the pizza itself (as it should be)! We also had one with mushrooms and a variety of cheeses that impressed as well. \n\nIf you like artisan, wood-fired pizza and live in Carmel and can't get a spot at Bazbeaux and don't want to drive all the way to King Dough, I highly recommend Pizzology,","categories":["Local Flavor","Italian","Pizza","Restaurants","Food","Beer","Wine & Spirits"]}

{"stars":4,"text":"What a wonderful find!\n\nMy husband was in the mood for a good charcuterie plate, and it being late notice on a Friday night, we couldn't get a good reservation time at sideberns or Datz,  Luckily, we found this place on yelp.  What a gem!\n\nThe wine bar is behind the wine store, in case you walk right past the place looking for a separate restaurant.  ;)  There is plenty of parking at the private lot (free) just north of the building.  \n\nDecor isn't phenomenal, but this is one of those places where you can actually have a conversation.  So yay for sparing my sore throat!\n\nWe each went with a wine flight since we were unfamiliar with the wine offerings.  Wine is also offered by the glass or the bottle.  The wines are on the younger side, probably because everything comes from the wine store and not some Bern's-like cellar.  My flight (\"French Wannabes\") was lovely, although the Australian grenache was a bit jammy for my taste.  Whatever.  That's sort of the point of getting a flight of wines -- tasting a bit of a bunch of wines.\n\nWe started with a farmer's platter.  I have to say the cheese selection is fantastic and heavenly.  I'm less impressed with the meat offerings.  Presentation of the platter was great, although the tables are a little small for the large plank.  We also tried the bouillabaisse and the pork loin.  I really loved the bouillabaisse -- the broth was light and refreshing, lots of lemon and wine but sadly lacking in saffron, the fish was tender and perfect, and the mussels fresh tasting.  I ate all the bread, wanting to sop up all the broth.  My husband liked the pork loin and commented that the portion size was huge.\n\nWe will happily return!","categories":["Restaurants","Bars","Tapas\/Small Plates","Nightlife","American (New)","Venues & Event Spaces","Event Planning & Services","Wine Bars"]}

You had choices of turkey of course, ham and prime rib, all cooked to perfection there was a multitude of choices for side dishes which was abundant considering how busy they were.  The desserts  were ok your choice a chocolate mousse pie, pumpkin pie, brownies and a bite size sugar cream tart.  We were seated just outside the various buffet area near the back bar.  Paige  was our server, very attentive like said before it was very busy.  Paige had a great attitude, she also told us that if we didn't want to the buffet she would be happy to get whatever we wanted.  Paige came over to us numerous times checking if we needed  anything.  Would definitely go back sometime other then Thanksgiving.  I give the high  rating because it was worth the trip.","categories":["Restaurants","Gastropubs","American (New)"]}

Great prices, amazing store brands (organic), great selection, competitive with similar store selections. \nHere is the deal, download the app Coupons make it even better. Sometimes they give stuff away for FREE. I recently got a box of Cascadian Farms cereal (customer's choice) FREE simply by clicking a coupon on the app and scanning my phone. \nWhat else do you need them to do put it in your cart for you?  \n\nGrass fed ground beef 3.99 a lb, you cant even buy junk feedlot beef at major grocers for these prices! This place is just full of deals. Now honestly some things are pricey at times but they will be on sale soon enough just wait. \n\nSprouts has become my household's main place to shop, we used to shop at MacDill's Commissary for our primary needs but now we go here because the selection and price is BETTER. I feel better about putting NonGMO and Organic products on the table than the alternative.

Nice older man was the bartender on this day and as soon as we were seated he brought us two bowls of popcorn. Love that they do that! I just wish the ratio of regular popcorn to jalapeno cheese popcorn leaned a little more towards the jalapeno cheese. That stuff is GOOD.\n\nOn this day we only hung out for a bit, long enough to cool off, sit back for a bit and enjoy our cold beverages. A few brews between us and a vodka cranberry for my girl S. \n\nI've been to The Shanty on plenty of occasions and love the outdoor patio when the weather isn't quite so hot.

{"stars":4,"text":"I received a compliment the other day for my first review here.  In it, the gentleman was telling me he really enjoyed the tableside guacamole.  Whaaaat??  How did I not know this was a possibility?  Have I been living in a cave?  This travesty of justice must be remedied immediately!  So, the very next day I dragged hubby out for some.  Okay, I didn't drag him....  I cannot physically make a 220 pound German do anything he doesn't want to, but as usual, I digress...\n\nAs soon as we were seated and our waiter approached, I blurted out \"tableside guac, por favor\".   Next thing I know, a cart is being wheeled over to us with a molcajete, avocado, salt, lime, cilantro, onion and tomato.  We were asked if we wanted it spicy.  Yes, please.   A few moments later a delightful mound of yummy goodness was placed between us.  My arms are shorter, so I moved it closer to me.  :)  \n\nDear Guacamole Overlord, was this stuff ever FAB!  It was chunky and smooth all at the same time.  It was a little piece of heaven in a molcajete!  I think I found my new best friend in the maker of this glorious stuff!   I even convinced the people next to us to order it too.  However, they complained it tasted \"too much like avocado\".  Really?  Okay.....  But to hubby and me, it was so wonderful that we went again the next day.  But want to know what makes it even better??  It is less that $4!!

{"stars":4,"text":"What started off as a frightful adventure in a questionable part of town ended with a surprising gastronomical delight.  Our visit to this part of Saint Louis was to attend a special off-season opening of the haunted attraction \"The Limp Brewery\".  We had been assured when our cab dropped us off that we would have no issue hailing a cab for a trip back to the hotel.  \n\nUnfortunately, it was midnight we exited the haunt, and we discovered there was not a cab or business anywhere in sight.  After walking what seemed like an hour we stumbled on the Benton Park Cafe, which to our excitement was open and featuring live music.\n\nEven though we were tired and anxious to return to the hotel, one look at the menu had us all salivating.  It was one of those dining experiences where everyone wanted to share a bite.  We started with an appetizer of Beer Biscuits and Gravy.  Are you serious -- Beer and Gravy -- it was divine!  We loved it so much that we ordered seconds. I had the pancakes which were the best I've ever had.  Light and fluffy with just enough crispness on the edge.  Add the maple syrup and it was perfect. Each dish was as good as the last.\n\nThe service was good and it was just a great find all around.  The only downside was getting a cab.  The waiter called for two cabs since we had 6 people.  After 20 minutes the first cab arrived.  I waited with two others for the second which ended up being 1 hour later and the same driver.  My suggestion? Make sure you try this place but drive yourself.","categories":["Nightlife","Coffee & Tea","Beer","Wine & Spirits","Restaurants","Food","Breakfast & Brunch","American (New)"]}

That location is actually closer to my home, but this review is specially about the South Virginia location which opened fairly recently (within the past decade).  If I have one bad thing to say, it's that I wish all Ben's locations were as cool as this one.\n\nBen's usually has the best price in town on liquor (certainly far better than supermarkets), being bested only by Costco and Sam's Club (both of which have very limited selections).  Ben's features the broadest selection of spirits, wine & beer in Northern Nevada ... if you don't see it on the shelf, they can get it for you.  But the best feature of this particular location is the in-house tasting bar and the weekly wine and occasional beer and spirit tastings.  On various occasions they've featured tastings for premium sake, tequila, scotch, bourbon, etc., which sets them apart from every other premium liquor store in town.\n\nThe staff are friendly and really know their stuff.

I get a lot of slack from my friends in Philly for what I have to say about Zahav.

I usually get the cauliflower and Branzino and they are are well made, but nothing makes me go OMG that is amazing let me try to figure out how to make this. Reservations are nearly impossible. So I usually go put my name in and then go to a restaurant near by, have a drink and go back.

The cleanup was great. They picked up our empty dishes the minute we placed on the side- 5 stars for that. Another good thing was their beef bulgogi- a must try.

The whole gaming floor is mostly lit with blue lights that I find exhausting to my eyes. The set up is like you  are meandering from one area to another almost like your in a cave. \n\nSo why do I rate this casino so highly. What features could negate all the negative features aforementioned??? Two things Biscotti and Maggie Scott.\n\nBiscotti's Sunday Brunch is excellent. Here you will find properly thawed and prepared large shrimp cocktail. YOu can savor fresh perfect sized oysters with totally NO  gaminess whatsoever. You also get hugh, prescored top grade crab legs. This is accompanied by other added pairing such as wide variety of greens for your salad , cheese plate that offers more than the usual types , various cooked dishes. BUT the star of the brunch is the fresh seafoods.\n\nWhat can I say about Maggie Scott but to echo her favorite greeting...CHEERS. I had known her for more than 4 years. She is ever healpful and unlike other hosts who would use all tactics to make you spend more money she always tell you to find some time to relax, enjoy the casino facilities and get enough rest and sleep. I think she has been promoted and I have not interacted with her for several months but when I did recently it was like there was no lull whatsoever.

{"stars":5,"text":"Such a stellar experience. On the advice of the NYT we cabbed to the Bywater from the Quarter to investigate Bacchanal. \n\nIt's important to know how this place works: if you want wine and cheese to-go or to-stay, you buy that from the cashier in the shop itself. If you want a meal, head on back through the kitchen renovation to the outdoor area. Around the side of the joint is the food truck, and that's where you order and pay for your entree (cash only, y'all). \n\nWe picked two amazing cheeses in the store as well as a bottle of cava, and the store clerk handed the cheese over to the food truck for them to gussy up with amazing bread that must have been fried in olive oil, and some olives. \n\nAfter we finished the cheese and came down from the cheese-related high, we ordered from the truck. Two of us split the steak with duck fat potatoes and whipped feta and the pork dish. Both were excellent, and an amazing value at $14 each. Sorry I'm spotty on the details but that was several bottles in. \n\nThis is a gem.

But the toasted white was very good. I would recommend the white bread over the wheat here. And I would come back and get the same sandwich. The hot \"peppers\" are a little odd because they have other pickled diced vegetables (carrots and celery) mixed in.

Plus, it's not too far from where I live, so that's always a plus. \n\nWhen we arrived and one of the employees learned that it was our first time, he really took the time to give us a run down of all the different products available. He even stepped out from behind the counter to our side, the customer side, and walked us through the displays while explaining the types of sausages they had. \n\nAlthough it's quite small, there are a lot of options and my husband and I were having trouble choosing what to buy - we wanted to try a lot of things! We finally decided to go with their original brats, the beer brats, and the garlic brats. \n\nWhen we got home, my husband cooked the original and the beer brats in a cast iron grill pan (we don't have a real grill yet). Both varieties tasted great! I can't wait to try the garlic brats and to return so we can try other things (probably the Andouille sausage and the peppered bacon). \n\nThey don't have every kind of meat, but they're a specialty shop and what they do have, they seem to do it very well.","categories":["Wholesale Stores","Food","Butcher","Specialty Food","Meat Shops","Shopping"]}

{"stars":4,"text":"My roommate and I have had fairly positive experiences with UCH. We've lived in two different properties owned by UCH. Although I can't speak for others' experiences, I do have a hunch that many of the negative reviews on Yelp and other sites are posted by spoiled, entitled Penn students who don't understand the realities of living in old, urban properties such as Victorian conversions and who don't know how to deal with living in a place that needs a little cleaning when you move in.\n\nWhat's been great: The properties we've lived in are beautiful (with the problems you'd expect from a renovated Victorian) and conveniently located. I can't speak for other UCH properties, but the two we've lived in have been lovely. My most positive feelings about UCH stem from the fantastic customer service. Those who answer the phone are reliable and take time to answer your questions in as much detail as you need. When I signed up to tour a few properties for my second apartment, Lizzie G (incredibly helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly) offered to show me a few other apartments that she thought I would also like. One of them in now my current home. Every other person whom I've interacted with has been friendly, flexible, and followed through on their word. For instance, when I showed interested in moving into another UCH property with a lease that began a month earlier than my current lease ended, UCH was willing to terminate my current lease early and provide a few days of overlap when I had access to both apartments. I've also been able to reach and get the help of UCH staff when unexpected circumstances arise. For example, when moving a mattress out of a 3rd-story apartment, I realized I would need to open the door of a neighbor's apartment--a neighbor who happened to be away on vacation. I called UCH and within 10 minutes, a friendly worker was there to help unlock that door. Lastly, repairs have been prompt and scheduled at a time that works for us. When we moved into our current apartment, it was overdue for new linoleum flooring and a new refrigerator. UCH scheduled to come in when we were away for a trip so that they wouldn't disturb us. When we later requested the installation of 3-prong outlets and a towel rod, repair workers came within the next month. \n\nOh, and I also want to add that UCH seems to really listen to its tenants' concerns. A number of trees in the yard of our current apartment had to be chopped down for safety reasons. When some resident expressed how bummed they were about it, UCH offered to build some raised beds so that they could grow a garden in the newly sunlit yard. How cool is that. The raised beds are there now and we are using them. I feel well cared for.\n\nMy only complaint so far is with heating; in my first apartment, it took until mid-November for the heat to turn on. It was weak until earlier December after many times of calling UCH. I am still unsure whether this was penny-pinching on UCH's behalf or a genuine misunderstanding of exactly how cold it was. Eventually they did get the heat pumping. And eventually I came to realize that an old Victorian will never have the best heating anyways.\n\nThat being said, overall my experiences with UCH have been well worth it, and I have recommended this leasing agency to many others.","categories":["Apartments","Home Services","Real Estate"]}

I finally wanted to get outside of my food box and try something new. You get nacho's & dip for free (unlimited), which was already a great start. I got the Speedy Gonzalez meal, and was pleasantly surprised. The Enchilada was amazing, the sauce was super delish. I also loved the Spanish rice, but thought the soft taco was lacking. I had got a daiquiri as well, and it took the whole meal to finish. I've been back every week since we first checked this place out, which was about six months ago. I am actually eating leftovers as I type, haha. My go to meal is the Chicken Yolandas. They are amazing! The sauce is fabulous, a bit of heat, but not too much that it's inedible. The white ranch dipping sauce is to die for, but be careful because the heat kicks up in the back of your throat.

While it was tasty, it's also made with soy milk.  This is how I discovered I have a soy milk allergy, which caused me to quite literally itch from head to toe.  Thankfully, no Epi-Pen or hospitalization was needed (just anti-histamine tablets).  But PLEASE keep this in mind IF you are allergic to soy in any form.","categories":["Steakhouses","Restaurants","Nightlife","Bars","Cocktail Bars","American (New)","Wine Bars"]}

{"stars":5,"text":"This is a very nice, relatively new facility housing both the humane society and it's veterinary clinic as well as the Washoe County Animal Control.  Parking can be a little tight at times but I've always been able to find a spot without waiting very long.  Upon walking in the facility you immediately breathe in the scent that's familiar to animal shelters, a bit like a mixture of cleaning supplies and wet dog smell but not entirely unpleasant and you get used to it quickly.  The front areas are used for cat and kitten cages, bunny cages and cat colonies.  They have a very large amount of beautiful adult cats waiting for forever homes.  Farther in, down the hallway are the dog kennels which are open to outdoor courtyards.  Each kennel has an inside area and an outside area, some with more than 1 dog, and they must have been cleaned recently as I didn't see feces in any of the cages.  I found a puppy I thought I'd like to see and asked the front desk if I could \"meet and greet\" the pup I had selected.  I was led to a meeting room and the pup was brought in to visit with me for approximately 10 minutes.  I had decided I was in love in less than 5 minutes.  When the staff person came back, she took the pup and told me to go to the front to fill out paperwork.  You have to \"qualify\" to adopt a dog.  The questions were basic.  Mostly about your basic information and your other pets and why you want another pet.  Easy questions.  Then, there's more paperwork.  All of the paperwork took about a half an hour.  Mostly, they just want to know that you're going to be a responsible pet owner, that you'll take care of your pet medically, and that if it doesn't work out, that you will bring the pet back to them.  You have 30 days to decide.  After 30 days, it costs $25 to return a pet.  They call themselves a no kill shelter and since I have been looking for a few months, I recognized a few dogs that have been there for a while.  Sigh.  The adoption cost $50.  If the dog of my choice had been 1 month younger, it would have cost $200 because he would have been considered a puppy under 5 months of age.  They told me to go to Petco, PetSmart or Pet Supermarket and ask for the new puppy coupon book to get coupons for free food and more, which I did.  The puppy was due for his Canine Influenza vaccine on the 13th so I prepaid $10 for the vaccine and went to the clinic next door for an appointment the following week.  Then, I went to the Animal Control also next door, and got a dog license for $8 because he's neutered.  It was very convenient.","categories":["Animal Shelters","Veterinarians","Pet Sitting","Pet Services","Pet Stores","Pets"]}

{"stars":5,"text":"I don't think I've ever had more fun eating at one restaurant. The vibe alone here gives it at least four stars.\n\nA friend and I came here on a recent road trip through New Orleans kind of by happenstance. A lot of the other restaurants were closed and coincidentally this place was closing in an hour or so but they gladly took us in.\n\nThe Cameillia Grill is famous both in the area and fans of AHS: Coven as scenes of the FX series were shot here.\n\nIt's a small diner with a few chairs going around essentially the grill\/kitchen. A group of guys me and the entire diner from cooking cleaning serving and hosting. Each one of them had a smile and brought an absolute level of customer service and care to their customers and they made us laugh.\n\nNow for all intents and purposes, this is a diner. A no-frills, not fancy establishment. You're going to get hotdogs, hamburgers, french fries, and maybe a Po boy.\n\nSince the meals are made to order they happen to get made quickly on the large grills they have. I ordered the sandwich that basically was two hamburger patties on a hoagie roll and it came with a side of fries. Not the healthiest thing I know, but hey it's vacation. We laughed as I eat my meal because we heard the guys working there talking and giggling. The guy said he never seen anyone finish that meal. Little did he know how quickly I would finish it because it was so good, and actually I could've maybe had part of another one.\n\nLike I said this is standard diner fare. But it was so good. The guys who work here make it even more special and it makes you want to come back for more.\n\nOh! And get the pie, they are known for it!","categories":["Sandwiches","Restaurants","Breakfast & Brunch","Burgers","American (Traditional)"]}

I tried the catfish and it was wonderful - grilled not fried with parsley potatoes, french bread and banana pudding.  The banana pudding put this lunch over the top!  \n\nIt's very casual and typically filled with regulars that the staff knows by name.  They don't take credit cards, but do checks.

It was not bad at all. Very Shocking to me! Normally a restaurant with advertisements using adjectives like \"good\" or \"Best\" are nasty tasting or not even real gumbo.

He was nice and knowledgeable about many things on the menu as well as in the store. He even suggested things for me to try and taste before buying.

Their seating area is open and clean and even if it is packed you wouldn't be right on top of everyone.  Everyone definitely needs to stop settling for 'ok' pizza and eat here.

I also love that they take reservations. Our server and the maitre d' were so nice, also. I started with the Melograno salad, which was boring and had the sea bass for dinner.

{"stars":4,"text":"I was leery trying the restaurant as I'm a die-hard fan of another local pizza establishment, but I had some coupons (and being broke) decided to give it a go.  Am I glad that I did, when we ordered we did a bit of a sampler to try a bunch of items we liked and I was quite happy with all of them but especially the chicken tenders and bosco breadsticks (addicting).  I also tried a Caesar salad and asked for fried chicken but ended up with grilled chicken (I guess they knew I was a fatty) instead.  Unfortunately if that's my healthy option I'll stick with my fatty foods because it was dry and bland.  Outside of that snafu everything else was delish, pizza was very good as well.  Haven't tried the wings but will post an update when I do. But the best part was the cheap prices!  We've since ordered\/picked up from here about every 1-2 weeks as a result.","categories":["Pizza","Chicken Wings","Restaurants"]}

{"stars":4,"text":"We had a great dinner at Radice on Saturday evening.  Sampled many small plates and a couple of entrees at a table of four.  Frittura was excellent, as light as fried food can be.  Calamaretti was also great.  The calamari was very lightly grilled and the radicchio was cooked perfectly.  We all liked the peperonata as well.  The pizzette Boscaiola was my favorite dish of all.  Really delicious thin crust pizza.  The bucatini was delicious as was the grilled branzino.  Oddly, my least favorite dish was the namesake Radice salad of roasted beets.  I thought it was overdressed, but others at our table enjoyed it.  Service was warm and gracious, but they are still working the kinks out.  For example, we waited too long for our drinks and bread.  Overall, we were very pleased and will certainly return.  Thanks to Toto and staff for an enjoyable evening.","categories":["Restaurants","Italian","Pizza"]}
{"stars":5,"text":"$4.50 Regular Cone\nThe Creolaise is the most popular sauce. (Given, given the area) I also requested to taste the Andalouse, which I liked better, but my friend was a bigger fan of the Creolaise. These chips don't have staying power (having it fresh is best), which I can't remember if Belgian fries are supposed to, but if they're twice fried... possibly! \n\nOtherwise, this was the EXACT food I wanted as I was walking around the French Quarter. It's just the perfect walking food and the only thing that would have made it more authentic was if it was wrapped in newspaper and the oil from the fries started to make some of the words bleed onto the potato, haha. But the cones were classy, no doubt.\n\nThe owner mentioned that the potatoes are organically sourced, which is what we attributed the naturally sweet taste of the potato to.","categories":["Restaurants","Fast Food"]}
{"stars":4,"text":"There's nothing especially special about this place, which is exactly what's so great about it. There are no servers, so you place your orders with the bartender and the food is delivered by the people who cooked it. There's something comforting in that, when the cook is willing to look you in the eye and say, \"Here, I made this for you.\" Anyway, they have a great goat cheese-basil-BLT, yummy chips (which I recommend coating in Crystal hot sauce), and the boudin was yummy. \n\nSide note: someone should take whatever seasoning it is they use to make boudin and bottle it up and sell it, and make potato chips flavored with it, and sprinkle it on everything that's ever been in a fryer. Like Old Bay in the mid-Atlantic. Seriously, it's so good.\n\nBack to the story: I was not a fan of the two New Orleans beers on draft (that blonde ale tasted slick, almost like oil), but that's not 13's fault. The bartender was nice, they had Godfather 2 on the TV, and the food was good. What more could you want for a quick post- or pre-drinking dinner?

{"stars":4,"text":"Pangaea is a Hillsboro Village staple and one of my favorite stores in the area.  They've apparently been around for 20 years which is impressive for a small, locally owned and operated store (and refreshing in our culture of chain stores and monotony).  They define the term eclectic kitsch, walking in the door is like hitting a big red flashing 'sensory overload' button in your brain.  There are things that draw your interest every way you turn and it is hard at first to pick something to focus on.  Shopping in there sometimes makes me understand what it feels like to have ADD.  It's amazing how much time you can spend in there, especially considering its small size.  Usually I have to take three or four laps around the store before I feel satisfied that I've looked at everything.\n\nYou can expect to find everything from clothing and accessories to jewelry and trinkets, house wares, gifts and unusual thing-a-ma bobs that fit in between.  Their wares remind me of that cool aunt that is kind of used to maybe be a hippy that has done some globetrotting and is an authority on random pieces of information.  It's a good place to go gift shopping especially for those people who are hard to shop for or have 'outside the box' taste.  Their clothes run on the small side so if you're itty you'll be fine but if you've got any parts that are a bit larger than 'average' you might find some difficulties.  I'm a big accessory freak, and I love their selection of purses and sometimes find myself on the edge of hyperventilating trying to decide what jewelry I want to take home.  \n\nThey offer a lot of handmade and one of a kind items which is really cool but can get expensive.  It can be hard to shop here if you're on a strict budget, usually I only let myself go in Pangaea if I have some extra cash or if I'm looking for a specific person.  Be prepared to spend some time here not just because of all the bright, shiny things to look at, but because of the store layout as well.  It's generally packed no matter what time of day you go and there is so much stuff crammed in the store you find yourself having to squeeze through people and openings just to get around.  Because of this at least one person knocks something over and breaks it every time I visit.  It takes a lot of concerted effort to not end up being that person.  Pangaea offers items for men and women, but their male selection is very limited and is usually of the ultra-trendy variety, so if they guy you're shopping for doesn't fall under that category he's probably not going to like the shirt you got him from there.\n\nAgain, like other Hillsboro Village establishments, parking can be a terrible pain.  Pangaea doesn't have its own parking lot so your stuck trying to find a spot on the street, or sneaking parking in Belcourt's pay lot and either shelling out the cash or crossing your fingers that you don't get towed (which I never have been but probably will next time because I say that).  When you're done shopping, be sure to hit up one of the cool bars in the area or go across the street and grab a delicious coffee from Fido.","categories":["Home Decor","Jewelry","Shopping","Event Planning & Services","Women's Clothing","Flowers & Gifts","Accessories","Cards & Stationery","Arts & Crafts","Home & Garden","Fashion"]}

I was in St. Pete's visiting for the week and my cousin told me this was the spot to stop by downtown, so I did what any other tourist would do and went along with him.\n\nWe got a table outside because it wasn't overly hot\/humid out yet. The hostess gave us menus and we glanced over them for brunch options. I don't remember our waiter's name but he was a more middle-aged gentleman and he did a phenomenal job at acquainting us to the menu. We started off with half a dozen oysters and the cheese plate, and for entrees I got the smoked salmon benedict while my cousin ended up with the quiche of the day. They also offered freshly squeezed pulp orange juice which we both agreed to get.\n\nThe oysters and cheese plate came out first and were both super fresh. Nothing like oysters at 11am, right? The combination of the freshly baked bread and some of the cheeses were insanely delicious, especially with the brie. Not long after, our brunch entrees came out and looked amazing. My benedict looked too good to actually eat, which was unfortunate because I was rather hungry. The flavor combinations from the egg, the hollandaise sauce, the cream cheese, and the smoked salmon was flawless. If I could eat this everyday, I totally would. My cousin's quiche was pretty amazing as well, having notes of ham, spinach, and other greens baked inside with a perfect texture.\n\nCassis is a great place to stop by in downtown St. Pete and hopefully next time I'm in down I'll have the pleasure of coming by again.","categories":["Brasseries","French","American (New)","Restaurants"]}

However, I ate here over a $20 a plate eatery down the street to save a few bucks.\n\n Queso with salsa and chips is an easy $4.99 appetizer with free beef mixed in the queso and the chips and salsa are free if you desire more. As an entree, I ordered the Redfish with crabsauce which comes blackened. I was pleasantly surprised I received a full filet of fish underneath multi grain rice w\/ two sides for $14.99. A second plate of food was ordered which was a rare six ounce sirloin with two sides which was received medium-well. Our food took about 20 minutes to receive delivered by the manager who apologized for the wait time.\n\nI wasn't mad nor inconvenienced because I expect things like this from restaurants in this category. I would return here for a cheap meal but definitely would avoid this place on serious date night or special occasion due to the atmosphere (loud and noisy) and the food descriptions include hand-cut instead of aged, wild, hormone free. Although the food was good (hot, large portion, colorful, arranged nicely) although not entirely what we desired (rare vs medium well) it was consumed quickly as I was hungry and got a lot for my money and in this sitaution that was I focused on.","categories":["American (Traditional)","Restaurants","Comfort Food","Southern"]}

Brunch was served in a delightful little courtyard which reminded me of being in a quaint European village, and the music and atmosphere was perfect. Brunch was a three course meal with bottomless mimosas and coffee. There were about five options for each course, and between the five of us we tried all the combinations. Everything was AMAZING! My one sister who is normally a vegetarian had the crabcake poboy and LOVED it, and I can't remember having more delicious bacon (just the right amount of sweet and salty!). Service was great, and the owner even stopped by to see how we were enjoying ourselves. There were no words I could say to her to express my enjoyment, so I was shocked to learn that this was her first Easter brunch and she had been quite nervous about it.

I came around 8:45AM on a Sunday and narrowly beat out the line out the door. I was a party of 1, and waited about 15-20 minutes. I got the strawberry shortcake pancakes and house coffee (unlimited refills). It was so good, and so satisfying! The only word that really comes to mind to describe these  pancakes are 'scrumptious', and I don't even use that word ever, so you know it's the real deal.

{"stars":4,"text":"This place starts off with great curb appeal. The exterior of the building is elegant, very pleasing to the eye. Entering, you immediately come the hostess station where I admitted that we had no reservation. I got a disapproving look and was told that if we went to the bar we would be seated shortly. On the way I noticed six or seven empty tables. It was a week day.\nThe bar is terrific with a marble top and top notch personnel. They have a digital tablet with all the spirits offerings and prices. It's very cool. My guest and I had a drink and chatted. After about twenty minutes and no hostess we decided to eat at the bar. We were set up and placed our orders. Shortly thereafter, we were served some very tasty bread and some herb olive oil. About thirty minutes later the Ceasar salads arrived. Really quite good. A decent portion and nicely seasoned. It was, however, overdressed and a lot wetter than it needed to be. But still very good.\nThen the real wait began. Forty minutes later a manager type offhandedly inquired how we were doing and I replied that we were starving. She took an interest and reappeared about ten minutes later with our pasta course. It arrived piping hot and was very good with a basic tomato sauce. In short order, the entrees arrived. My guest had a fish dish, grouper, as I recall, which she declared was very nicely done, served very hot and well seasoned. My veal with a lemon sauce was also served very hot and was delicious. As we had plenty of time to evaluate the setting, we concluded that the place is rather classy. The customers seemed affluent, middle aged and well dressed. The noise level was fine.\nIn summary, the food is great. The atmosphere is refined. We will return. As we left I had noticed that the empty tables we passed on the way in had never been used.","categories":["Italian","Nightlife","Lounges","Restaurants","Bars"]}

{"stars":5,"text":"From the time we walked into the showroom to the moment we drove off the lot, we were treated like family.  My wife and I prefer to initiate the purchase\/lease process via e-mail, text, etc, so we had already selected our vehicle and completed the pre-qualification process.  Upon arriving at Ferman BMW, Brandy Kennedy acknowledged and greeted us immediately.  Next, Karl Alvarez greeted us and introduced us to our sales concierge, Charlie Fernandes.  Charlie is the consummate professional and walked us through the sales process.  He continually made sure we were comfortable, asked if we needed beverages, etc.  While we were with Charlie, Alan Mazur stopped by to check on us and answer any additional questions. When I asked for his opinion between two different accessory options, he went so far as to make multiple trips to the parts department to bring out samples for us to look at.  Next, AJ Clarke came out to greet us and take us back for what is typically the dreaded process of signing all of the purchase\/lease documentation.  AJ made the process extremely efficient and pleasant.  She offered us a variety of additional warranties, protective products, etc, but was not in any way pushy or overbearing.  Once finished, AJ brought us back out to Charlie, who introduced us to our BMW Genius, Toby Pacuch.  Toby spent a substantial amount of time going over the features of my wife's new vehicle with her, from the obvious features to the less obvious items that will undoubtedly allow my wife to have the full experience of her new vehicle.  He even offered to meet with us at a later time at our location to go over any additional questions and features of which we are uncertain.  Finally, Charlie again met with us to reinforce that our relationship with him and Ferman BMW did not end when we drove off the lot. He provided us with his mobile number in the event of any questions, issues, etc. It's important to note that this entire process took only about 90 minutes, a substantial portion of which was spent going over the features of my wife's new vehicle.  Needless to say, this experience was both enjoyable and memorable.  We left Ferman BMW without the typical feeling of exhaustion experienced after spending the better part of a day at the car dealership. The team at Ferman BMW serves as an example of what the purchase\/lease experience can and should be.","categories":["Auto Repair","Car Dealers","Used Car Dealers","Automotive"]}

And normally, I LOVE a classic 'deluxe' style pizza. Their veggie version is not only colorful with their ingredients of dice spanish onion, onion, red pepper, green pepper, tomatoes, zucchini, mozzarella and cheddar cheese, but quite satisfying to your palate, and if you're a vegetarian, you will love their Dice Veggie. It has a little bit of a thick crust too which I like. \n\nTheir bread sticks (I had ordered the garlic cheese toast but they don't offer it anymore so had this instead) are much like the ones you'd see at Papa John's- long, oblong shaped sticks, and you have your choice of various dips- I had the ranch, which is good. \n\nThe food arrived timely as the guy on the phone had told me, in 45 minutes to my door, and my total for everything plus a 2 litre of Coke was $24.35. There was a delivery charge as I live north of downtown. \n\nAs their website says, their pizza is 'made with Whole Wheat Dough, Low Fat Mozzarella and our very own Pizza Sauce. We offer pizza by the slice, catering for parties and free deliveries on orders over $17.00 (a delivery charge may apply for deliveries over 8 kms)'. But they dioffer FREE Delivery on orders $17.00 and over within 8 kms. \n\nI've had a few other veggie pizzas from chains such as Pizza 73 and Papa Johns, and this is JUST as good, if not better than theirs! : )","categories":["Pizza","Restaurants"]}

You wouldn't think it, but these bad boys travel well. It's a good thing because the seating here is limited to six barstools and it stays crowded. You most likely will need to eat it in the parking lot or take it home. It's not a a problem though! Don't forget they are cash only, but there is an ATM in the market. \n\nMy only complaint is the price. It's now $16 for a full size sandwich. The quality is good though, so for a treat every now and then, it's worth it. The half size would be more filling if it came with a little side or something. \n\nThe only other menu item I've tried is the Mac and Cheese. The flavors rotate out. I love the crab and corn. They deep fry the mac and cheese, and it is a crispy masterpiece filled with decadent gooey cheesy goodness.

I think I would prefer grilled tenders but that's just personal choice.\n\nMy husband had the Grilled Cajun Tenderloin served with crispy fries. He was surprised with the garlic salt sprinkled on the fries. He's not a huge garlic fan but the seasoning wasn't super heavy. The tenderloin was large, seasoned well, just not as tender as he would have preferred.\n\nThere are 6 salads options for those looking for healthier choices. I was pleased with their soup selection of lobster bisque, shrimp, chicken and sausage gumbo, main street chili, french onion and loaded potato soup. I love soup and look forward to going back for several things but especially the Soups, Southwestern Blackbean Burger and Wood-Fire Pizza.\n\nRelaxed atmosphere, good food, friendly servers, and reasonably priced. Stop by if your in the neighborhood.","categories":["Restaurants","Pizza","Pubs","Nightlife","Bars","American (New)"]}

We had the pleasure of having Anastasia serve us.\n\nWhile considered \"fine dining\" on the Hard Rock website, we felt as though it was a step below that. We ordered three courses and wine and the meal was over in 45 minutes. We felt very rushed to turn our table over. The dress code is very casual as well. Not exactly what we were expecting in a fine dining atmosphere.\n\nAll that said, we loved the pizza. The pasta is homemade in-house.\n\nIf you are looking for a quick and delicious meal, go to Cipresso!

The bread is great, and the ingredients are fresh.  Service is quick and they get the orders right.\n\nDelivery is as quick as they advertise, and the fact that they're open until 4am is a big bonus.\n\nThe only drawback for me is the ambient noise in the place.  They absolutely blare the music so loud in there that you sometimes have to shout your order.  Maybe they do that to discourage loitering, considering the nightly influx of drunk people that comes in after the bars close, but I'd really like to enjoy my sandwich without the annoyance of ringing in my ears.","categories":["Fast Food","Sandwiches","Restaurants","Delis"]}

Also, the lady at checkout was very nice too.  I have some issues (yep that getting older thing) and unlike with some doctors I've been to lately where they rush in and rush out without a word and you're left to wonder what just happened, Dr. Hodges answers my questions and explains what's going on with my eyes.

{"stars":4,"text":"My brother heard about Big Cat Rescue because of their YouTube channel.  We were down in Tampa and planned to check it out.  You have to go to their website and choose to buy a ticket and reserve a spot on one of their tours.  They have several options for tours and usually at a time in the morning and afternoon.  The cheapest is the day tour at $37.  We went on a Saturday and our choices were 10AM and 3PM.  Once you buy a ticket, they email you a waiver to sign to help speed up the process.\n\nBig Cat Rescue wasn't the easiest place to turn into but that is more of the city's fault.  We had to make a U-turn at a light past it to turn into it.  So beware of that.  The driveway is also dirt and lots of holes.  Think about that for the car you choose to take.\n\nWhen you get to the gate, you are greeted by the staff to make sure you have filled out the waiver.  Then you are led into the shop as you wait to go over a few rules before you go on the tour.  You have a volunteer tour guide to explain about the cats and another that stays at the end of the group to make sure there are no stragglers.  At orientation, they give you a headset so when you come to each cat, you can listen to that cat's story.  Each cat was rescued from a circus, private owner, etc., and cannot be set back into the wild because the cat does not have the skills to survive in the wild.  They take excellent care of the cats and do not force them to come out for tours.  But no worries, about every exhibit we came to, we were able to see the cats. I think there was only 2 that we did not see.  But they have several of the same type of cats.  You are allowed to take photos of all the cats and post them on social media.\n\nThe tour guides were very knowledgeable and something I even learned is that lygers are actually real, not just an animal Napoleon Dynamite made up.  The tour lasted about an hour and 45 minutes.  This was worth the $37 I paid and I even feel more sympathetic now for our government having laws against owning wild, exotic cats. It's just a horrible and dangerous idea in my opinion.  \n\nI was glad to have the experience Big Cat Rescue offered.  But it is also one of those things that I would never do again unless I am with someone that has never been.","categories":["Hotels & Travel","Zoos","Active Life","Tours","Arts & Entertainment","Pets","Education","Animal Shelters"]}

{"stars":5,"text":"TL; DR at the bottom: \n\nDespite this review being long overdue, I've felt for some time the necessity to speak on my experience with this place. Getting my license & driving on the roads -- especially in a state with drivers like the ones in Louisiana -- I was reasonably afraid of being put behind a massive, metal machine of death, & slightly less terrified of being bored to that same death from the stories of friends who had attended  mind-numbing driving classes at different places in the past. \nHowever, I was pleasantly surprised by my experience with the folks down at Drive Dat Academy.\nI'll start by speaking on the kindness of just about everyone on the roster. While you typically expect employees to have a base level of friendliness, it truly felt at times like the staff were going above and beyond to make you feel welcome & as if you were buddies. The upbeat atmosphere is a constant throughout the course. \nThe instructors carried a variety of enthusiasms that will keep the average attendee engaged to some degree, but we all know you can never truly keep the attention of a teenager. However, it felt like Drive Dat was trying to keep the lessons lively, which is so important given the subject material. As entertaining as the rules of the road could possibly be, I sensed a determination to good driving education, which any parent or reasonable student will appreciate given the cost of most driving schools. \nOnce the hands-on training began, I was lucky enough to be paired up with Mr. Mike -- a seasoned vet in both the comedic world and driving one. Speaking solely in my experience, not only was I laughing a lot, but I was also learning so much. While the experience with others may differ, Mr. Mike went out of his way to try & create a comfortable atmosphere for any nerves I had, while still being friendly & very conversational. I ended up not only learning how to handle four way stops, but also what true passion in education looks like. By the end, I was not only confident in my abilities as a driver, but I also felt like I gained valuable wisdom & a treasure trove of bad puns & gut busting jokes. \nI walked out with a new understanding of the rules of the road, confidence in my abilities as a driver, & with an appreciation for the work that comedians do behind the scenes. The instructor was even kind enough to drive me to the DMV to get a license I felt I had finally earned the right to carry. \n\n\n\ntl; dr: \npros: in-depth driving education, detailed analysis of common\/fatal mistakes, upbeat atmosphere, friendly staff, informative\/friendly instructors\n\ncons: newfound fear of trains, sore laughbox, & a craving for Dot's Diner. \n\nall in all: entirely worth the price of admission. makes what feels boring entertaining. if you go in with an open mind to sit through classes & pay  attention -- you WILL learn how to drive, & you will feel much more confident about your skills behind the wheel. definitely recommend.","categories":["Education","Specialty Schools","Driving Schools"]}

{"stars":5,"text":"Of all of the things I saw and did in a whirlwind tour of Philadelphia, Di Bruno's is what will probably stick in my head as my favourite.  My guide was an old grade school friend who's become quite a foodie like me, and one of the first places she brought us was the Italian Market and into Di Bruno's.  We started sampling all sorts of cheeses, as if it was almost forced upon us, but wow, they have some incredible products.  It was early in the morning and we decided after basically a complimentary brunch of antipasti and cheese we'd come back later to pick up some stuff for a picnic lunch on our way to our next stop, NYC.  The guy who was helping us basically made us a \"cheat sheet\" of all the things we tried so we knew exactly what to ask for.\n\nWhen we returned later that night, we started trying various meats to complement the cheeses we'd pick.  What really impressed me was the product knowledge.  Everyone in the store knew what they were selling in great detail, which really added to the experience.  We walked out with quite a lot more than expected (with no regrets) as a result!\n\nOverall, a great place to visit and experience, the ideal model for an Italian deli I think.  I'll be back.

The portion is small so each person should have their own taco. I ordered the Smothered Pork Chop. My husband said it was the best tasting chop he had ever had. The gravy excellent. My husband ordered the Honey Stung Fried Chicken Dinner. The waffle was like dessert. Our sides, corn bread and marinated cabbage were also excellent.\n\nWe were so curious about the other dishes that we spoke with the couple next to us. He ordered the Jambalaya Stuffed Peppers and loved it as well.\n\nThe atmosphere was perfect for our family too - casual and pleasant. We brought our very busy 21 month old and we felt comfortable having him there and occasionally got out of our seats to walk around and let him explore. When we arrived the waitress quickly brought him some orange slices which kept him contented while we ordered and waited for our food.

{"stars":4,"text":"While touring the botanical gardens, we kept reading the foreshadowing comments about the cafe - Twilight Thursdays involve a 3 course meal at Cafe Botanica, as does Al Fresco Fridays, signs with arrows pointing us in the direction of the cafe, etc. etc. so when we finally found said elusive cafe in the Botanics, we had to try something.\n\nHaving just come from a breakfast place, none of us were extremely hungry, but it was getting hot outside, so we decided to look into iced teas. \n\nAs we walked towards the cafe, we moved past the adorable, shaded outdoor seating areas, eventually making it inside the cute house-style cafe. At this point, I did my necessary phone charging, as we looked over the menu. We decided that ice tea was the necessity: two of us trying the Prickly Pear and the other going with the Mint Cardamom. Both were delicious and refreshing, especially with a little bit of added stevia - already in liquid form.\n\nWe sat in the air conditioned area, talking a little bit with a woman, who I secretly considered the owner of this adorable establishment. I enjoyed looking over the cafe menu - a great selection, that is not absurd in price, and I fell in love reading the back of the menu. This side includes the (local) areas in which their receive their food, their story, as well as their overall food philosophy. This place utilizes and supports local farmers, letting nothing to to waste and provides delicious, healthy foods. This is my place. \n\nI would love to experience the Botanical gardens, as well as the entire flavor of the Cafe on their Twilight Thursday evenings - a 3 course meal for a mere $20. This is on my list of things to do the next time I'm in Tucson. Cafe Botanical is an excellent addition to the Botanical Gardens. It really feels like it enhances the experience (the food having been given just as much care and preparation as the plants it's surrounded by), and it provides a lovely place to stop and relax while dealing with the heat that is Southern Arizona.","categories":["Restaurants","Cafes","Mexican","American (New)"]}

However, a place that large was destined for issues.\n\nHowever, the space is now being put to more practical use.  More than one business lives in the building, including a theatre, record shop, restaurant, and Sophie's Artist Lounge & Cocktail.\n\nAt first, I wasn't interested in checking it out. My friend does a pop-up karaoke, and when he hosted his first one at Sophie's, I didn't go.  Midtown doesn't have a lot going on, aside from SLU campus taking up the majority of the area.  However, I gave it a shot the second time around, and I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nLocal favorite Jeremy Pevnick basically does double duty as general manager and bartender.  If you haven't had the pleasure of meeting him, he's a great guy and very good fit for this bar.  People come to Sophie's just to see him, and for very good reason.\n\nSophie's is meant to be a hub for artists and performers, and since the bar is above a theatre, the patrons are often connected to the productions.  It can get a little dramatic up there (see what I did).  However, it's usually a great time, and the people are very friendly.\n\nLike I mentioned, my friend Brian hosts a monthly karaoke there, and it's a lot of fun.  He also does it at Monocle in The Grove, but I honestly like this venue better.  There is a ton of space in the bar, and they even have a sweet rooftop patio.  There's not a point where I feel crowded or uncomfortable.\n\nHowever, there are a few issues.  First of all, it sits above the theatre, and we couldn't start karaoke until the production was done.  Last time the show below ran long, and we lost a lot of time.  Also, Jeremy is pretty much by himself.  Once the night takes off, he could probably use a little help behind the bar.  Otherwise, it's a great hang.\n\nHave a drink.  Sing a song.  Meet Jeremy.

{"stars":4,"text":"We went out on a Thursday night looking for a bite to eat without too much ado. Arriving at Barrel House we realized it was exactly what we were looking for. It was filled only about a third to half capacity, so it was not too loud. We sat in one of the booths close to the bar, which provided a great view of the games on tv. \n\nFor drinks we had two of the Boulder Mojo Risin'. It was a Double IPA with a very light aroma of grapefruit after taste. It was one of a large selection of craft beers on the menu. \n\nWe ordered the often recommended Brussel Sprouts. They came with a mix of apples, bacon, almonds, and onions. They did not disappoint. I could have had five orders of those and been happy. The Lamb Sausage was recommended over the Duck Confit from the waitress. She said the chef likes cooking the sausage better. It was quite tasty, not too spicy and the mustard didn't overwhelm it. It did take a little bit too long to come out, which the server did acknowledge that it was put on after our Brussel Sprouts had already been finished by us. For an entree I selected the Braised Short Ribs over a sweet potato and broccolini. All of the taste complemented each other well and I was happy with the selection. They do not short you, no pun intended, on the ribs, either.\n\nOverall I was pleased with the venue, staff, and food. I would recommend it to anyone looking to get a bite without going too upscale, but rather looking for a comfortable place with good food.","categories":["Food","Breweries","Nightlife","Pubs","Sandwiches","Comfort Food","Bars","Beer Bar","Restaurants","Breakfast & Brunch","American (New)","Sports Bars","Gastropubs"]}

{"stars":4,"text":"I stayed at the Springhill Suites in Voorhees for a recent wedding and had a great experience from the start. There was ample parking and a covered driveway near the front door, which helped to get us and our stuff in on that horribly rainy day. \n\nWe arrived prior to our check-in time and were rolling the dice to see if we could get our room early. It was no problem. Not only were we able to check-in, the girl at the front desk was a sweetheart. She was friendly, helpful and the perfect example of how someone in the customer relations field should act. \n\nOur room was large, clean and really maximized space. There was one TV in between the \"living area\" with the couch and the \"bedroom.\" There was plenty of closet space. While there was no separation between the toilet and the rest of the bathroom, the toilet was on the opposite side of the shower creating another great use of maximizing space. \n\nThe reservation also included a breakfast buffet the next morning. While it was far from gourmet, as far as hotel breakfast buffets are concerned, it was pretty decent. Standouts included scrambled eggs, some sort of potato hash with sausage and peppers and a waffle maker. You could top your eggs with cheese, spinach and salsa in addition to 3-4 different kinds of hot sauces and condiments. \n\nThe elevators were the only flaw to this hotel and the reason I'm deducting a star. Could they BE any slower? (Said like Chandler Bing from Friends). The hotel only had 4 stories, so we opted to take the stairs when possible. \n\nThis hotel is within 20-30 minutes of home so there's really no reason for me to need to stay there again, but I would recommend it to anyone needing to stay in the area.","categories":["Venues & Event Spaces","Hotels & Travel","Event Planning & Services","Hotels"]}

It took me a minute to know where to go in & I finally asked someone where to go to get service.  It's actually very simple (once you know).  There is a sign that says 'Enter' (now don't think I didn't see it but it wasn't clear to me that I could just drive thru without telling anyone)\n\nAnyway, \"Enter\" & pull around thru the line, there will be techs there with hand held cash machines to enter the car wash option you choose.  THIS IS THE PLACE TO REQUEST ANYTHING special because you won't see anybody again until the end or unless you go outside and walk up to them while they are drying and vacuuming etc...  Don't forget to tell them which smell good scent you want (or don't want) in your vehicle.\n\nThen you pay right there, they print your chosen option & tape it to the inside window of your vehicle so the techs know what service to complete.  They have a very nice waiting area (it has no TVs or music, also only one or two outlets if you need to plug in a phone or laptop).  But it also looked like it had just been newly renovated inside so that may still be coming.  I'll add an update if that changes.

I also have to say that I absolutely, 100% HATE having to pay a cover to eat a bar and grill!!!!!! I remember a long time ago when there was no cover and back then I loved this place. Then some years ago they started charging $5 at the door and I never came back, until this past weekend for a girls night out. Guess what? The cover had somehow gone from $5 to $7!!!!!! I was pissed but I still entered, ate, and enjoyed my time there.\n\nThe Dirty Muggs was playing, which it's safe to say that they are St. Louis' \"premier\" cover band at this point. The place was packed and the music was great! If you get a chance to see them here, I say go for it! It's not a bad concert for $7.\n\nAs for the food, I had a classic cheeseburger and fries and a few well drinks (hey, no judgement). The drinks were all in the $4\/$5 range because I didn't order top shelf liquor. Their potency varied. The food wasn't bad. One friend ordered the wings and loved them, which Syberg's is known for its wings so that was no surprise. Another friend ordered the shark bites. She let me try them and with their seasoning, they were pretty good, different.\n\nOur waitress was excellent. She was possibly the only waitress working in the place, and she constantly checked in on us and the other tables around us. One thing that was strange though was that she had to keep an open tab even though we were at a table. She blamed it on a management decision, which I can understand. My check came back correctly at the end of the night so I'll allow it. lol\n\nBecause of the cover, I will never become a regular here. However, knowing that the cover is sadly here to stay (and seemingly increasing with inflation...), I'll just know what to expect the next time a group of friends decide to go here. Still, there's no doubt that you'll enjoy your time here, whether you're here to watch a game on one of Syberg's ton of TVs, or to see a good local group perform.","categories":["Arts & Entertainment","Sports Bars","Restaurants","Music Venues","American (Traditional)","Bars","Nightlife"]}

I may never be able to eat \"satay\" elsewhere now. We sampled all of the meat-based sat\u00e9 sticks, all wonderfully seasoned and grilled to perfection: crispy outside but juicy inside. Sat\u00e9 kajang was my favorite (try the goat!) but the pork sat\u00e9 malaka was sweet and amazing too. Bungkus (wrap) is a personal choice: I loved the teeny tiny vermicelli of the mild, velvety mee hoon goreng bungkus, but my husband dug into the spicy nasilemak bungkus (spicy rice mixture) and left no traces behind! We shared small plates of rendang daging (beef), which was by far the best we've ever had; and ayam kurma (chicken and potatoes), which was creamy and delicious, with spices reminiscent of India. \nIt's byob, and cold lager was a good fit for this menu, although drinking a real coconut looks refreshing too, perhaps with a drop or two of byob rum.

{"stars":4,"text":"Wow, this place is fantastic. We had such a great time. Is it pricey? Absolutely. You pay for the experience. But, with three levels, multiple bars, video games, pool tables, shuffleboard, etc. it is worth it. \n\nMy husband and I were at our bay for an hour. It was $40. There were a bunch of games to choose from. This is way more economically friendly when you have a  group. You can have up to 6 people at a bay. \n\nMy one gripe? You have to pay $50 to reserve a bay in advance! That is effing ridiculous. We arrived on a Saturday morning around 10:30. The parking lot was surprisingly jammed. We had to pay a flat fee of $5 for a membership card each. No biggie. We then had over an hour wait. So we sipped on bloody mary's and sat at the bar. It would be nice if we didn't have to pay $50 to reserve a bay in advance though. Especially because we are driving from South Tampa. But it's a great way for them to suck more money out of their patrons (sit at the bar and drink\/eat while they wait). \n\nEither way. Great concept and we will definitely be back!","categories":["Golf","Sports Bars","Nightlife","Active Life","Bars","Restaurants","American (New)"]}

It's hard for me to make a clear judgment because by the time I got to eat my pole boy I was already at the airport it's been 20 minutes. However they do load it up with a lot of shrimps. The amount of shrimp was so much that every bite you take, the shrimp will just fall out from your sandwich. Although the sandwich waited 20min for me to take the first bite, it was still a satisfying sandwich. The bread may be soggy but it was still very flavorful. \nThe service at parkway was really quick, it took less than 10 minutes.

{"stars":4,"text":"I think this is a nice place to see one in your life. It is a small historical site right outside of downtown Philadelphia and it would be a nice getaway from the hustle and bustle of the city. The place is surrounded by a larger park with lots of other things to do and areas for picnics. \n\nParking can be a major hassle during the weekends and definitely during the spring time since everyone - and I mean everyone - is trying to bum rush the place. I think when I came here, the place was packed and it took 3 hours to get inside the place... yes, you heard me. 3 Hours. After about 2 hours of waiting, I was too stubborn to give up even though I was getting a tad bit hungry. \n\nInside was small, but would have felt bigger if it was not as busy. They do have the house area where you have to take off your shoes to walk around. Then they have the outside garden area. The little bridge to the island looks pretty, but you can't walk on those. I can see why. \n\nThey have koi fish everywhere and you can buy food to feed them. I recommend making a friend in line while you wait for 3 HOURS and split the cost of feeding the koi fish. \n\nOverall, it was a nice experience and if you want to see more cherry blossoms in the spring, you can easily see more at the park right outside. Also, if you can, the weekdays are probably much better for the experience and likely can get some nice shots without people everywhere.","categories":["Arts & Entertainment","Cultural Center","Venues & Event Spaces","Botanical Gardens","Event Planning & Services","Museums"]}

As we say and waited for the counter person to bring us our food, we were entertained with televisions and their were also a PAC man game and other games and a photo booth- additional charges but still pretty cool and entertaining- deff good of you brought kids. \nThe food came and was so tasty, the milkshake was the best and we were told it was Jack and Jill Ice cream that they use- which I really like! The steak was cooked so well and had a good flavor. The whole time me and my mom were barely talking because we were chowing down.

There is a nice bar with adequate seating and lots of tables. There were several patrons there when I arrived and more came in as I was waiting for my food.

I was very hesitant to take him to see someone to talk to because I was unsure if he would be receptive to this type of process.  I made an appointment with Healing Minds for an initial visit and my son was seen by Chris Edwards. The office was clean and open and inviting and the staff was very friendly and engaging. The atmosphere did not feel medical or sterile in any way.  My son was very defensive and closed off at first but Chris had a great way of talking to him and getting him to open up and start talking about what has been going on.  Chris has been great not only helping my son but helping me learn how to help my son as well.  He is teaching him to recognize how he feels and strategies to utilize in the real world.  We have not been going for long but there is already has a huge improvement in his attitude, behavior and ability to recognize and regulate his emotions.

The mashed potatoes were delicious with brown gravy. Oh did I mention the vegetable of the day was Mac and cheese? Awesome. My husband said the pulled pork was delicious.

I love gnocchi and have clearly never had it as pillowy, soft and perfect the way Southwark does it!\n\n\nI'm looking forward to trying the bone marrow appetizer, I've seen it ordered a lot and just haven't yet taken the plunge. \n\nTheir wines are exquisite and they have a great beer selection. They can also mix up some great cocktails! The bartenders and hostesses are always so so nice. They can definitely get busy in there because they have a huge bar and a few tables in the bar section, plus they have to make drinks for the restaurant part..but you're never left thinking they don't notice you or you're forgotten. \n\nAnother great thing is they serve the majority of their menu until late night which is either 12:30 or 1 depending on the day.\n\nSo happy this spot is in my neighborhood!!","categories":["Breakfast & Brunch","Nightlife","Cocktail Bars","American (New)","Coffee & Tea","Bars","Food","Restaurants","Desserts"]}

He returned my call within 30 minutes early on a Saturday morning and added me on to his busy day. Unfortunately, he could not make it out until 6pm but the other companies I had called could not make it until Monday!! He showed up about an hour earlier than he thought he would be able to get there and was kind and courteous. He was incredibly knowledgeable and just by looking at the unit he knew what was wrong and said he could have it fixed in 10 minutes with replacement of a small part. Sure enough I had air conditioning 15 minutes later. Cost for his service was fair for an emergency call. I asked him what he thought of my aging unit and he said \"leave it, I like to fix, not replace.\" I'll certainly be recommending him to others in the building!!!

I went to get my lady bits ready for bikini season. This was my first time at this location. I love the attention for detail, she went over a few times to make sure everything looked perfect. The only thing I would say they need to change is last process. There wasn't any cleaning done after the wax except picking up the old left over wax and applying some baby powder. No oil to take off the left over residue. When I got home, there was still a small clump of wax stuck between both of my skin down there. I had to clean it up, just wish they would add that additional service.","categories":["Waxing","Hair Removal","Beauty & Spas"]}

{"stars":5,"text":"SHORT REVIEW: This is a review about a place that makes a sandwich. You should stop whatever you're doing and go purchase a sandwich from this place that makes more than one sandwich. If you've got an adventurous bone in your body you will love it\/them\/those\/that.\n\nLONG REVIEW: There aren't too many places that get the unknown mix of attributes that keep people coming back right. (Sidenote: Is there a list? Has a retail psychologist made such a formula?) Back to the matter at hand...sandwiches.\n-- LOCATION\/\/SPACE: Goose is a phenom. May it always remain open. Not only is the location convenient (it's 'downtown') and comfortable (it's in a neighborhood), it also offers a place to park. Once inside, you'll realize how much punch is packed into the tiny package. Stop by awhile. Bring your laptop; there's seating. There's a gelato section. There's a full butcher counter and charcuterie display. There's frozen and refrigerated items. AND, ..there are stairs...\n....\n........\n............\nthat lead down into a delightful cavern of beverages. The cellar is, indeed, a place to behold. And the record player seals the deal. Bring your own vinyl and chill.\n-- FOOD\/\/DRINKS: In no way, shape, or fashion is this your standard grocery store. But they've got an collection of assorted goods from meats and cheeses to the best breads, beans, pickles, Harry Potter potions, wines, beers, ciders, sodas, gelato, and yeah...Variety was born here. Be an explorer when you step into GtM. Yes, that's right. Put on your 'I'll try that' hat and taste the rainbow. Cheers to whoever scouts the goods they stock here. But let's get back to those sandwiches. There are 2 or 3 that stay on the menu, and 3 or so that rotate into the menu from time to time. The rotating ones often have some very strange ($#!*) on them...but they work! It is unknown how these tastes are accomplished at this time. The consistent ones are more approachable, if not even more wonderful. The one snag here is that almost everything is PRICEY. But 'you get what you pay for,' right? Indeed. The quality here is top-tier. They make no sacrifices here. It's all extremely worth it. So, maybe the fare here is a bit more of a treat or special occasion for most.\n-- SERVICE: I've talked about the stuff here a lot, but it's really people that make the magic. The staff here is a gem. They created a community through giving some of the best customer service in the city.\n\nWhy did it get 5 Stars? Everybody loves 5 Stars.\nCome for the goose, stay for the vinyl.","categories":["Food","Sandwiches","American (New)","Restaurants","Specialty Food","Beer","Wine & Spirits","Meat Shops"]}

I called several restaurants in south philly to make a reservation for 15 people on a Saturday evening. They were the only restaurant that was accommodating when scheduling the reservation. Our server Allie had a great attitude, was amazing, and very knowledgable about the food and beverages. My party of 15 turned into a party of 20 and they handled it calmly with several seating options to accommodate the situation. The warm and cozy environment made it feel as though I was having some friends over to my home for dinner.

{"stars":4,"text":"My pictures will reflect how much we used our room.  In no way was it abused, just used to it's fullest potential.\nAfter noticing that the hotel we were booked with was close to this one, I quickly cancelled the fisrt reservation and rebooked with Residence Inn.  I'm really glad we stayed here instead.  Wifi seems to be strong and free and there's no verbage on their website about purchasing an upgrade.  The buffett breakfast was great.  Make your own waffels, cooked oatmeal and lots of toppings, fresh fruit, cereal bar, eggs, egg whites(!), bacon, hot rice, tortillias(breakfast burrito anyone?) Breads for toasting and coffee bar.  For free!  We ended up taking ours back to our room for personal comfort level reasons.  Our son sometimes can't do the social thing and that's okay too!  The room,  though worn,  was clean. Bathrooms were spotless.  Beds were comfy and clean.  Fresh linens and towels.  Plenty of everything.  There is an ironing board, iron and a bag that has an extra blanket and bottom sheet.  The kitchen had everything we needed.  We were going to do naan pizzas with the groceries we picked up at Trader Joes, but there wasn't an oven. So I used the toaster to get the bread just right and the microwave did the rest.  \nYou are given dish soap and dishwasher detergent for cleaning and a dish rag and towel.  Pots, pans, cutlery, dishes, drinkware all at your disposal to make your stay comfortable.\nThe folks working here have been very kind and helpful.  I need just a little ketchup (for hot dogs, not pizza) and without hesitation, I was given a couple of packets.  Saving me from buying a bottle.\nOur stay was only overnight.  But I can see how this would easily be a choice over conventional hotel rooms.  You save money and get better food being able to cook yourself.  The full size fridge\/freezer allows you to stock up for your stay.  Free breakfast is a big money saver too.  It's quiet here so you'll get your rest and we were invited to their social mixer where they were serving dinner fare.  I suppose you could make a meal of it.  We chose to turn in early instead.\nIf you can overlook some slight imperfections and enjoy the rooms for what they offer, this is a very good choice.\nWe stayed in an accessible room so we had 2 bathrooms, 2 befrooms, 3 t.v.'s and room to breath.  Our son is handicapped so the layout works best for us.\nI highly recommend this Residents Inn.","categories":["Hotels & Travel","Venues & Event Spaces","Hotels","Home Services","Real Estate","Apartments","Event Planning & Services"]}

My husband has the farmers omelet which was huge and full of ingredients with little fried potatoes that we both love. My only critique would be that they were a bit heavy handed on the feta this time. It is usually just on the spinach but was all over my eggs. Feta is strong and in my opinion can be used sparingly.

Amazing beers on tap, super friendly service, and the ambience was better than I expected. Just go here! Trust me!

{"stars":5,"text":"This is by far THE best restaurant during our three-day stay. The environment is clean, modern, and inviting. The staffs are very friendly. Most importantly, the foods are outrageously good. I'm a food lover and a good cook myself. My first exposure to Cajun food was through a cooking book written by chef Paul so naturally the K-Paul's Restaurant was on top of my must-go places during my stay. The day before I finally went there but left feeling unimpressed. That experience filled me with certain doubts when I went to this restaurant this afternoon. Boy was I surprised! The wood fired oyster was so good I had to order one more plate. It is served on a bed of rock salts and the oysters are juicy and full of flavor. I normally prefer fresh raw oysters with little  spice added, but now I'm a convert. I will choose these cooked oysters over any raw ones without blinking. The fried alligator is very good too. The breading does not override all the flavor and preserves the unique texture of the meat quite well. Eat each piece with the fresh mint leave provided and you will enjoy a quite complex taste unlike typical fried stuff. The fisherman style fish is a masterpiece as well!\n\nAll in all, this is one of the few truly memorable dining experiences I've had in my life. It has been a few hours and I'm still in food coma. LOL.","categories":["Cajun\/Creole","Seafood","Restaurants"]}

The line during lunch was long (which I perceive as a good sign) but moved quickly and we didn't wait more than 10 minutes for our sandwiches. We got chicken salad on a whole wheat roll. When we got it we were confused because it seemed a bit dry for chicken salad. After talking to the sandwich maker, turns out we were rung up for rotisserie chicken (and we opted out of the cheese) which explained the dryness. Without even asking, they made us a new sandwich exactly as we wanted it (and let us keep the wrong one as well). Great customer service and the sandwiches were really tasty. The macaroni salad was good but nothing I have not tasted before. \n\nI recommend Snarf's for a tasty casual lunch!","categories":["Restaurants","Breakfast & Brunch","Salad","Food","Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt","Sandwiches","Beer","Wine & Spirits"]}

Because I was an out of town college student I was really concerned about taking my car to any mechanic in the city. After searching and reading reviews, I decided to try this shop. Their service was fantastic, they got me in and fixed my car with no issues (and were more professional than the shops were I am from)! I took my car there a couple of more times and each time was the same, great!\n\nAfter college I moved back home, and I still always visit the city since my friends and girlfriend still live there. This past weekend on Friday night, I was in town visiting my girlfriend and my alternator died on my car. I was sure I was stuck for until at least Monday. I called Ken's explained the situation on Friday night, he told me to call back on Saturday morning and see if he could fit me in. Well, I was called back Saturday morning and he said to bring it down and see what he could do. \n\nWell, what can I say...He was able to fit me in on a Saturday and stayed an hour passed their closing time to get me back on the road. This shop is incredible! Although I live over 70 miles away I am planning to bring my car back for a couple of other issues and my inspection!!\n\nUpdate 3\/18\/16:\nTook my car back for inspection and the service was great. Had a check engine light on and they ran the code and determined that it was a blocked airway. They said they could try basic clean out vs. disassembling the whole part and see if that would reset the code that it would be way less expensive to try that first.

{"stars":4,"text":"I I had a good time today at Hammerstone's. A friend and I found a spot at one of the patio tables and made ourselves comfortable despite the heat. It took a moment for one of the staff to notice our presence, but part of being human is having patience, though I made a note (as a server myself) that the poor gentleman working the patio could have done more with his steps. Granted, he was managing at least nine tables alone, but the concept of round-pouring comes to mind. \n\nBreathe, my man; being twice as efficient is the same as being twice as fast.\n\nVicki, a server who came out to give him a hand, was very attentive once she made it to the table. She was a sweetheart if I've ever met one. Admittedly, the restaurant seemed a little under-staffed, but that's more of an issue with management. For whatever reason, the entire two hours we were there, I failed to notice anyone who struck me as a manager come out to check on the patio.\n\nHaving noticed us, the drinks arrived in a timely fashion and our appetizers soon followed. The T-ravs were crispy without being burnt, well-seasoned, and matched the sauce perfectly. I cared less for the risotto balls, but that's more a matter of personal preference, I think. They still deserve praise.\n\nMy grilled firecracker chicken sandwich was spicy, but not overpowering. The fries were crisp and salted to perfection.\n\nMy only other comment of note is that the music didn't much seem to match the environment except for the odd classic rock song here and there. I've heard good things about the live musicians they host, but can't claim to have seen any there myself. It's a good spot for it. In any case, new-age pop belongs elsewhere.\n\nAll in all, a good time.

If you're looking to celebrate a special night for an anniversary, birthday or a date to impress, I'd put this as a top choice in st Pete. Very intimate. \n\n1st time ordering charcuterie and  we were very impressed. Ever since, we've been making it a point to order charcuterie wherever we dine if it is available on menu.  For cheese we got the purple haze goat cheese (7 dollars), which was superb. For our meat option our server  suggested the calabrian salami (8 dollars), and at first I was apprehensive but promised us it was amazing and thin sliced. We certainly were happy because it had small pieces of jalape\u00f1os that had a little kick that we loved. Got the crispy Brussels Sprouts special(9 dollars) and it was good but a little salty in some bites.  If you hate Brussels sprouts, I would say this dish could change your mind. The 2nd best dish of solely Brussels sprouts that  I've had. Number 1 being the unique creation at Noble Crust in st Pete . The bread squares cut out like thick cake  squares with the pesto dipping sauce was amazing. The bread so doughy and soft. The agave cocktail  I ordered, I don't recall name was very well made  and balanced( 12 dollars-picture posted). Got a glass of BTG Craggy Range white wine (13 dollars). Boyfriend ordered Stellas at 7 dollars a piece. \n\nFavorite dish of the night was the lamb belly pasta\/ taleggio agnolotti (20 dollars) . The crispy salty little pieces of lamb best described as  crunchy salty bacon pieces. But salty in a good way! Server recommended the scallops dish. It's was good but I was expecting it to knock my socks off for 38 bucks price point.  I didn't like the very \"al dente\" almost undercooked  and hard diced butternut squash that was paired with the dish. Not very flavorful, seems like the squash wasn't ripen enough. But not a bad dish nonetheless.  Scallops big, fresh, melt in your mouth buttery.  Our entire bill for charcuterie, appetizer, 4 drinks,  and 2 entrees was 130 dollars.

We are thrilled to have Paramour in Wayne and it looks like we will be back soon.","categories":["Restaurants","Breakfast & Brunch","American (Traditional)","American (New)","Bars","Nightlife"]}
{"stars":4,"text":"Would rate a 3.75 if I could. This place is definitely no fancy bowling alley like the small setup at Pinewood Social. That being said, it is way way way cheaper, and can have a fun grungy kind of aesthetic if you read it right. Which is to say, this place is definitely \"divey,\" and very old\/outdated. The food was cheap and wonderfully greasy, and the beer was good, and they have a pay-per-play jutebox\/itunes system-type thing which is pretty great. The staff was a little cool at first--in large part because they were busy, there was only 1 woman who could serve alcohol, and then 1 assistant\/worker who was a teenager\/still learning the ropes-- but quickly opened up and were awesome and very kind and helpful.","categories":["Active Life","Bowling","Nightlife","Bars","Food Stands","Restaurants","Arts & Entertainment","Arcades","Amusement Parks"]}

{"stars":5,"text":"I would HIGHLY recommend this company.  They serviced my 15 year old system that covers a large amount of area (nearly and acre), fixing leaks,  moving and adding emitters and generally brought the system back to life.  Plants that had been struggling for years have taken off, citrus is covered in blooms and thriving.  I have worked with several irrigation companies over the years, and I can say that I sincerely trust these people.  They told me I did not need a new redo and that saved me thousands.  I don't know what the problem with the buyer beware post was, but I would highly recommend this company.  No, I have no stock in it and these people are not \"friends\".  Just a good straightforward company.","categories":["Landscaping","Irrigation","Landscape Architects","Home Services"]}

{"stars":5,"text":"So. \nLet me keep it real here.\nI disclose that I simply do adore Arnold Myint both professionally and personally. He just may be my brotha from anotha motha. You dig?\nHowever, it has been that way for quite some time and as you can see from my previous review was 3 stars... however, I felt compelled to review Cha Chah again because this establishment has certainly stepped it up several notches in my book. \n\nVegan and vegetarian options are quite plentiful and delicious at that. The key here is to communicate to your server what your dietary restrictions are. When I made my reservation, I noted that a vegan diner would be a part of the group. \nOn Friday night, I had a scrumptious feast of the Roasted Beet Salad ($9) that was a flavorful burst to start my meal with oranges, thyme, arugula, and candied walnuts. (we just excluded the feta) Then our table shared the Citrus Zest Hummus ($5) because quite frankly I demanded it... I am addicted to hummus. This one didn't disappoint either. \n\nThe main course was a SPECTACULAR Mushroom Lentil Meatless Loaf was presented in such a beautiful way that one would forget that what you're getting ready to indulge in  is simple comfort food. Not here. The flavors of red pepper jam, coconut curried carrot puree, broccoli, roasted turnips,  and balsamic reduction were robust and (without regrets) devoured the entire thing. Throw is a fabulous bottle of wine and my evening was nothing short of perfect.\n\nToday, I headed back for more at brunch and the results were the same. This is one happy vegan. A divine potato hash ($5) and the citrus hummus started off the meal and then a special quinoa dish ($8) with onions, squash, and more still has me feeling satisfied hours later.\n\nThe service has always been on point and I love the casual refinement of the space as well. \n\nSo. \nIs Arnold Myint my friend. \nYes.\nIs he a damn amazing chef?\nYou bet your ass.\n\nTIP: Great spot to book large dinner parties or events! I have hosted a large group lunch and cocktail our here and both were executed beautifully!","categories":["Asian Fusion","Modern European","Tapas Bars","Restaurants","Breakfast & Brunch"]}

{"stars":4,"text":"If you have the time in the Tampa International Airport prior to your flight (or if you aren't in a rush to go to baggage claim right away), check out Columbia. Finding solid Cuban cuisine north of the Broward-Dade County Line is truly a challenge, but Columbia does a nice job. \n\nI had the Grilled Mahi Sandwich, and it tasted like south Florida. It was very familiar and comforting like the food you may find on Calle Ocho. The staff is very friendly and the service turn around time is quite quick. The plantain chips did me in, and sent me to heaven. Get some ice water with lemon because some of the dishes may be a little saltier than what many are used to. \n\nDepending on the time of day, the restaurant can get loud.

{"stars":5,"text":"The barren post-Xmas, pre-new year's weekend is usually a no-band's land for Tucson as all the big players gear up to take stage on New Year's Eve. The Boondocks, a serious blues venue whose clientele knows more about music than a trolley full of horn-rimmed hipsters downtown, hosts some of the most amazing shows in this town. It helped that we got one of those miraculous tables which afforded full view of the band, easy dance floor access, and a clear path to the back door where a girl might sneak a smoke and get to see Dave Alvin pull up in a sparkling Green Impala.  Blues, boogie-woogie, funk, and jazz all have a comfortable home here beneath the crumbling wine bottle. It's rare even in bigger cities  to find lineups of the caliber who regularly play here, an achievement by the seriously devoted Tucson Blues Society which puts the \"school\" in \"old school.\" The crowd, including plenty of out-of-towners and kids who weren't born when the bands on stage were racking up Grammies, was probably over capacity, but as always here, enthusiasm is contagious. Boondocks is still a music mecca, even with the burgeoning downtown venues. A show like this for $15 without the drive to The Rhythm Room is one reason why The Boondocks is a priceless Tucson treasure.","categories":["Cocktail Bars","Bars","Dive Bars","Nightlife"]}

The management team here is a breath of fresh air, they seem to not skip a beat. All the way back to when I first signed my lease until now almost a year later the resident attention to detail and care has not diminished in the slightest. The maintenance team is well informed and swift to resolve any and all issues (including a heater incident which was repaired and back to perfect within an hour). The facilities are kept clean, the location is wonderful and conveniently nestled near plenty of restaurants and stores without the pitfalls of feeling unsafe. I couldn't recommend these facilities or this team enough.","categories":["Real Estate","Apartments","Home Services"]}

{"stars":4,"text":"The brunch offerings are pretty solid here and I love that they offer the trademark crispy calamari salad and creamy gruyere and fontina (yum!) lobster mac and cheese during those weekend mornings when you just want something inherently un-breakfast-like and savory.  The tofu skillet is decent here but I have yet to find a curry tofu skillet that rivals the Friendly Toast's.  They use silken tofu here so that may be the issue since I prefer my tofu skillets made with a firm, more cutlet-like tofu but your mileage may vary; the curry flavor was savory without being too intense and there was plenty of veggies, including an eclectic mix of both basil and scallions.  The baked french onion soup dumplings are a creative must-try.  Just get them.  You won't regret it.  It does get packed during brunch hours so you will probably have to wait but the food is good, the ambiance upbeat and fun, and the service friendly.

Ensure you come during happy hour to take advantage of their drink specials.\n\nI have visited this establishment several times over the years and as always I once again had the corned beef boxty and a Guinness.  Sliced corned beef, Swiss cheese, and a horseradish mayo sauce wrapped in a potato pancake with seasoned cabbage.  Wish I could tell you more about their menu but this is all I ever order as it is just fantastic.  If you'd like to BAM it up a notch with some flavorful heat sensation, ask for the small jar of Coleman's mustard.  \n\nI really enjoy stopping at a venue for a bite to eat where great service, superb meal, and cold beer is always the norm.
